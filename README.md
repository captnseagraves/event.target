Event Target is a web-based application that curates a custom event calendar based on your interests. EventTarget wants users to get out and explore, investigate, and meet rad people that enjoy the same activities as themselves.

As a user comes the homepage they will sign to Event Target using Facebook. Next, they will be taken to the "Categories" page where they can select the types of events they want to see populated into their "Feed". On their "Feed" users can choose individual events to add to their calendar or subscribe to venues that often hold events that they are interested in. After selecting events users can view those events on their calendar in a number of different views. Now, a user can check in and always see what is happening around them that day, week, month, and beyond.
