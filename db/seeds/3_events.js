Spectacle’s orchestral instrumentation (violin, percussion, guitar) quickly made the outfit stand out amongst the crowd; each show being an experience, that is refreshingly original. Hard hitting drops, alongside afro-cuban percussion make for an irresistible groove and a heady tropical soundscape. Beautiful soaring violin melodies, and deep rhythmic bass synth lines drive each musical passage through every member of the audience. Band members Michael Mahan, Jessica Borth, and Rob Brandon work in unity gripping the crowd for a show that is both mesmerizing and captivating from start to finish. Spectacle brings their audience through an innovative and dynamic journey show after show after show...\n\nhttp://www.spectaclemusicusa.com/",

    "description": "A trailblazing exploration of the poetic power of popular songs, from Tin Pan Alley to The Beatles to Beyoncé and beyond.\n\nEncompassing a century of recorded music, this path breaking book reveals the poetic artistry of popular songs. Pop songs are music first. They also comprise the most widely disseminated poetic expression of our time. Adam Bradley traces the song lyric across musical genres from early twentieth-century Delta blues to mid-century rock 'n’ roll to today’s hits. George and Ira Gershwin’s “Fascinating Rhythm.” The Rolling Stones’ “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction.” Rihanna’s “Diamonds.” These songs are united in their exacting attention to the craft of language and sound. Bradley shows that pop music is a poetry that must be heard more than read, uncovering the rhythms, rhymes and metaphors expressed in the singing voice. At once a work of musical interpretation, cultural analysis, literary criticism and personal storytelling, this book illustrates how words and music come together to produce compelling poetry, often where we least expect it.\n\nAbout the Author: \n\nAdam Bradley is a professor of English at the University of Colorado, Boulder where he directs the Laboratory for Race & Popular Culture (RAP Lab). His commentary has appeared in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, and in numerous other publications. Bradley is the author or editor of five books, including “Book of Rhymes: The Poetics of Hip Hop,” “The Anthology of Rap,” and the New York Times bestseller “One Day It’ll All Make Sense,” a memoir he wrote for the rapper and actor Common.",

From playing on the streets of Cannes and the hedonistic heights of St. Tropez, breaking world music barriers as one of the rare groups to climb the U.S. and World music charts. Featured in the likes of “The Big Lebowski,” “Toy Story 3” and “Glee,” the band has embraced western classics by Bob Marley, the Doobie Brothers and The Eagles with globe-hopping grace, whilst also incorporating dramatic cues from Brazilian and Caribbean culture.\n\nNow bringing the party back to the United States this summer, The Gipsy Kings will raise the roof with dance-ready furor, returning to their groundbreaking eponymous album and the nomadic spirit that has led them to their latest, “Savor Flamenco” – giving audiences the “deep shout at the heart of our community.”",

Join us on Saturday June 3 as we host a small group of 8 anglers to the private waters of Mother Lake and the Big Thompson River at Sylvamndale Ranch.  Your rod fees for this trip will help the ongoing efforts to restore the River and Ranch property damaged in the flood of 2013.  We will take some float boats for Mother Lake where the fish are healthy, strong, and pushing the 2 foot mark.  The wild fish in the river have rebounded and the ranch property habitat has improved to hold more and larger fish.  Come see a piece of history with Rocky Mountain Anglers at Sylvandale Ranch on June 3.  At just $150, you get a guided experience, a grilled lunch, 3/4 mile of private water on the Big T, and a chance at a trophy out of Mother Lake.  Bass Ponds are fishing great too and included in the outing.  Call 303-447-2400 to sign up now!",

    "description": "John Gierach, “the voice of the common angler” (The Wall Street Journal) and member of the Fly Fishing Hall of Fame, brings his sharp sense of humor and keen eye for observation to the fishing life and, for that matter, life in general.\n\nJohn Gierach is known for his witty, trenchant observations about fly-fishing. In “A Fly Rod of Your Own,” Gierach once again takes us into his world and scrutinizes the art of fly-fishing. He travels to remote fishing locations where the airport is not much bigger than a garage and a flight might be held up because a passenger is running late. He sings the praises of the skilled pilots who fly to remote fishing lodges in tricky locations and bad weather. He explains why even the most veteran fisherman seems to muff his cast whenever he’s being filmed or photographed. He describes the all-but-impassable roads that fishermen always seem to encounter at the best fishing spots and why fishermen discuss four-wheel drive vehicles almost as passionately and frequently as they discuss fly rods and flies. And while he’s on that subject, he explains why even the most conscientious fisherman always seems to accumulate more rods and flies than he could ever need.\n\nAs Gierach says, “Fly-fishing is a continuous process that you learn to love for its own sake. Those who fish already get it, and those who don’t couldn’t care less, so don’t waste your breath on someone who doesn’t fish.” From Alaska to the Rockies and across the continent to Maine and the Canadian Maritimes, “A Fly Rod of Your Own” is an ode to those who fish—and they will get it.\n\nAbout the Author: \n\nJohn Gierach is the author of numerous best-selling books on fly-fishing. His work has appeared in Field & Stream, Gray’s Sporting Journal and Fly Rod & Reel, where he is a regular columnist. He also writes a column for the monthly Redstone Review. He lives in Lyons, Colorado.",

    "description": "The Indigo Girls have spent thirty-five years performing together, produced fifteen albums (seven gold, four platinum, and one double platinum), earned a Grammy and seven Grammy nominations, and have toured arenas, festivals, and clubs the world over. It is rare to find musicians together so long, rarer still with such profound successes. Their music lives in the hearts of generations of dedicated fans and continues to inspire young musicians. This loyalty is not accidental. Perhaps their relevance over three decades can be credited to the mighty collisions of distinct aesthetics forging new paths over time. The Girls’ refinement — not only of style and skill, but of their own creative processes — allows access to ever new and liminal spaces.\n\nA long creative marriage fosters its own scrappy beauty, though, and theirs grows more nuanced, weatherworn, and lovely in each successive album. Saliers and Ray live separate lives, take on independent projects, but share “the same set of values,” says Saliers. “We both embrace the struggle, share the same energy. We are sisters in our embrace of life. Observers.” That sort of artistic kinship is rare and cosmic. Here, then, are the stars of that labor, the next chapter.",

    "description": "The SteelDrivers’ innovative, soulful brand of bluegrass has made them one of the most successful bands on the contemporary bluegrass scene. Winner of the 2016 Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album for “The Muscle Shoals Recordings,” the band speaks in their own accent, one that charms and sears and beguiles.\n\nRichard Bailey’s banjo plays funky, little Kentucky-goes-to-Memphis rolls. Tammy Rogers’ fiddle soars. Brent Truitt’s mandolin chops time, and Mike Fleming’s bass pounds the downbeat. And all that is righteous and right-on. Elevated, even. But Gary Nichols—he lets loose something the opposite of righteousness. It’s a howl, full of hurt and anger and life. Starts on the highest E note that 99.9% of male singers can hit, then ascends into a sweet falsetto, and then opens up like the gates of Hell, into a reeling screech.\n\n“I think that’s what moves people when they come to see us: the realness and rawness and edge,” says Rogers, who formed the SteelDrivers in 2005 with Bailey, Fleming, multi-instrumentalist Mike Henderson, and soulful singer (and now-acclaimed contemporary country artist) Chris Stapleton. That version of the SteelDrivers received three Grammy nominations and won an audience that was surprised and initially saddened by the 2010 and 2011 departures of Stapleton and Henderson. But the entries of Nichols and virtuoso mandolin talent Truitt have created a SteelDrivers band that carries the gutbucket ethic of the original combo, but pleases in different ways. \n\nThis is a band like no other, by inclination but not by calculation. Nichols, Rogers, Bailey, Fleming, Truitt … Those of us who have listened all know where their souls are bound. Bound to triumph. Bound to rise. Bound to matter. Bound to resound. Bound to impact. Bound to roar and shimmy, to howl and heal. A damn good band, this one.\n\nGinny Mules will open tonight's show.",

Seu Jorge’s adaptations in Portuguese of David Bowie’s music underscore the breadth and depth of his compositions and have gone on to have a significant cultural impact.\n\n“Had Seu Jorge not recorded my songs in Portuguese, I would never have heard this new level of beauty which he has imbued them with.” — David Bowie",

Produced exclusively by Live Nation, the 25-city jaunt kicks off in Chicago on July 13 for the two classic-meets-contemporary sensations, both of whom mash up classic pop stylings and modern pop hits in their own unique fashions. \n \nPresale for both fan clubs begin on Wednesday, February 15th at 10am local time through 10pm.  More information including VIP Packages can be found at http://www.sncmusic.com/ and http://postmodernjukebox.com/.\n \nAs the official credit card for the tour, Citi® / AAdvantage® cardmembers will have access to purchase presale tickets beginning Thursday, February 16th at 10am local time through Friday, February 17th at 10pm local time. For complete details, please visit citiprivatepass.com.\n \nBoth bands deliver contemporary pop songs with timeless flair - the stylistic diversity, real musical and vocal skill, and dedication to craft of a bygone era. Straight No Chaser shirk the blazers and khakis of campus a cappella groups for something far less strait-laced (or straight-faced), training their jaw-dropping vocal prowess and soulful harmonies on past and current hits. Scott Bradlee’s Postmodern Jukebox reimagines contemporary pop, rock and R&B hits in the style of various yesteryears, from swing to doo-wop, ragtime to Motown – or, as Bradlee himself puts it, “pop music in a time machine.”\n \nIn the process, both groups have found remarkable success and attracted dedicated fan base who appreciate their unmanufactured talents and joyous energies. Since Bradlee created PMJ in 2009, the project has amassed more than 650 million YouTube views and 2.5 million subscribers, chalked up more than 1 million likes on Facebook, performed on “Good Morning America,” topped iTunes charts with all 14 of their releases since 2014, caught the attention of NPR Music and NBC News, and played hundreds of shows to sold-out houses around the world.\n \nSNC have themselves garnered more than 80 million views on YouTube, made numerous national TV appearances including NBC’s “Today,” ABC’s “World News,” “Watch What Happens Live,” CNN, “Fox & Friends,” “20/20” and more. The group has played to countless sold-out audiences, making them continuously one of the top 25 touring artists in North America according to Pollstar magazine. The band celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2016 with a successful world tour and the release of its third full-length holiday collection, I’ll Have Another…Christmas Album. The album, which blended beloved carols with holiday favorites made famous by Coldplay, Mariah Carey and Stevie Wonder, followed their now-classic 2008 debut, Holiday Spirits, and its smash 2009 follow-up Christmas Cheers, both of which topped both the iTunes and Amazon sales charts and were certified gold by the RIAA.\n \nDespite finding such success for the project on the road, Bradlee continues to arrange and record new arrangements every week for PMJ’s legion of fans.  The multi-talented collective has interpreted hits by Lady Gaga, Beyoncé, The White Stripes, Lorde, Outkast, Radiohead, Maroon 5 and many more. Last year, PMJ collected 18 favorites from among their hundreds of songs to compile The Essentials for Concord Records. The album included the song that put the band on the map, a vaudevillian distressing of Macklemore & Ryan Lewis’ “Thrift Shop,” and their ‘50s doo-wop version of Miley Cyrus’ “We Can’t Stop,” which garnered more than 19.5 million views and was named one of the “9 Best Viral Cover Videos of 2015” by People magazine.\n \nStraight No Chaser originally came together in the fall of 1996 at Indiana University, quickly setting itself apart from other a cappella groups with its contemporary repertoire and dynamic approach while reinventing the idea of a cappella on the modern pop landscape. SNC has released six full-length albums, split between their three collections of holiday favorites and three that take on classic songs by artists like Elton John and Marvin Gaye as well as current megahits from Hozier, The Weeknd and Meghan Trainor. A host of music-world giants have shown their admiration by recording with the ensemble – iconic names including Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney, Seal, Phil Collins, Dolly Parton, Sara Bareilles and Jason Mraz.\n \nDon’t miss your chance to catch Postmodern Jukebox and Straight No Chaser live.  \n\nVIP Nation Packages available\nhttp://livemu.sc/SNC-Morrison\nhttp://livemu.sc/PMJ-Morrison\n \nTICKETS GO ON SALE SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 18 @ 10:00 AM\nat www.LIVENATION.com, www.AXS.com, or Charge By Phone at 888-9-AXS-TIX (888-929-7849).\n \nTickets are $79.95 & $59.95 RES and $39.95 GA plus applicable service charges.",

In a remarkable career that has touched three decades and produced a discography of 24 albums, the Sugar Hill Records recording artist of Al Schnier and Chuck Garvey on guitars and vocals, Rob Derhak on bass and vocals, Jim Loughlin on percussion and vibes, and Vinnie Amico on drums, continue to push the standard for performance art higher and further.\n\nWhether touring around the globe, headlining music festivals, or sharing the stage with such diverse acts as the Allman Brothers, Dave Matthews Band, The Who, Robert Plant, Government Mule, or Blues Traveler, among many others, what keeps moe. at the forefront of the music scene is not only the energy and vitality of their music and songwriting, but the showmanship in which it is delivered. Their music is clever, melodic, refined, filled with “ferocious guitar riffs” and “intricate rhythms” (Relix); their performances are entertaining, mesmerizing, and epic.\n\nFrom their humble, inconspicuous beginnings as a local bar band in Buffalo, NY, to headlining Radio City Music Hall on New Year’s Eve, moe.’s journey has been one of hard work, perseverance, and dedication. Critical acclaim and a solid national and international fan base has resulted in a dedicated following that grows each year. Rolling Stone magazine named Chuck and Al among the top twenty new “guitar gods,” The pair have been featured in Guitar World and Modern Guitar, Jim and Vinnie in Drum!, and Rob in Bass Player. The renowned guitar play between Al and Chuck has become the stuff of legend. The exceptional vibe and percussion work by Jim is brilliant. The understated bass play by Rob is masterful. The seamless, efficiency of Vinnie’s drumming is extraordinary. Together, the five create a musical synergy greater than the sum of their parts.\n\nThe news about moe. keeps getting better, too, in the studio and on tour. A new album, their second on Sugar Hill Records, is set for a 2014 release. It follows the critically acclaimed 2012 release, What Happened To The LA LAs, and the 2010 Smash Hits, Volume One—a rerecording of some of moe.’s most endearing classics. The band’s tour schedule is extensive, playing in venues, intimate and grand, from NYC to LA, San Fran to Atlanta, Chi Town to Bean Town, from Tokyo to Toronto, and across the Atlantic to Paris, Amsterdam, London, Hamburg, and Milano. Long a featured act at music festivals, they’ve performed and headlined at the likes of Bonnaroo, All Good, and High Sierra, in the US, and Fuji Rock Festival in Japan, and Burg Herzberg in Germany, to name a few; yet made time to promote and perform at their own festivals—Summer Camp, Snoe.down, and moe.down.\n\nBy all accounts, for this “legendary jam band,” as Rolling Stone described them, moe. represents rock and roll at its best. Welcome news for the moe. faithful and the band’s ever-expanding fan base. Even better news for the world of rock and roll, for moe. is just hitting their creative stride.\n\nhttp://www.moe.org/\n\nTWIDDLE\nWith roots at Vermont’s Castleton State University, Twiddle began their extensive touring career in 2005. Over a decade later, the foursome has composed an eclectic catalogue spanning three studio albums of originals, in addition to many live releases. Currently the band is digging in at the studio composing PLUMP Chapter Two, the second half of their acclaimed third album. Having performed at a multitude of international festivals, Twiddle’s trajectory shows zero sign of slowing. Look for them to pack prominent theaters throughout 2016, as they truly break through to the next level.\n\nhttp://twiddlemusic.com/",

Members Woody Platt (guitar), Graham Sharp (banjo), Charles R. Humphrey III (bass), Mike Guggino (mandolin), Nicky Sanders (fiddle) and Mike Ashworth (box kit) are also known for collaborations with actor/comedian and respected banjo player Steve Martin and esteemed singer-songwriter Edie Brickell. The Steep Canyon Rangers’ “Radio” was produced by fourteen-time Grammy® winner, Jerry Douglas (John Oates, Alison Krauss, Del McCoury Band) and recorded at Asheville, North Carolina’s Echo Mountain Recording Studio. The album’s twelve all-original bluegrass/ Americana tracks were written by Sharp, Humphrey, Platt and Guggino in varying degrees, including a few co-writes with fellow musicians such as Phil Barker of the Carolina bluegrass band Town Mountain. “Radio” follows Steep Canyon Rangers’ 2013 release, “Tell the Ones I Love,” which Bluegrass Today praised as “…a great mixture of today’s bluegrass styles, excellent harmonies, and a few surprises…an excellent album…”\n\nThough the tune is steeped in the bluegrass that has made the sextet an in-demand live draw, banjo player and singer Sharp says the album has a wider range. ““Radio” travels the dial from top to bottom,” he says. “The album tunes into the rock channel for a little while, then the blues, then country, pop and, of course, bluegrass.”\n\nThe Steel Wheels will open tonight's show.",

Through Verified Fan, fans will have presale access to tickets beginning Wednesday, April 26 at 10:00 am local time at https://kingsofleon.tmverifiedfan.com.  Tickets for the tour will be available to the general public for most cities beginning Friday, April 28 at 10:00 a.m. local time at www.livenation.com.\n \nThe tour’s initial announcement on the TODAY Show in October prompted an almost-immediate sellout of most of the dates, including major cities New York, Los Angeles, Toronto, Detroit and San Francisco.  The tour has received critical acclaim throughout its trek – of their sold out date at Madison Square Garden, Billboard applauded the show – which they hailed a “rock show spectacle” – for maintaining an intimate connection within a large-scale production. “Every element of the show felt as thought-out as the next… and while the show was certainly a spectacle, there was still something so genuine about its presentation.” Meanwhile, the Boston Globe praised the band for delivering a “royal, rousing performance” and The Patriot Ledger called the “arena rock powerhouse” band’s show “a bracing shot of vitality” and a “terrific rock ‘n’ roll party.” Speaking further to the tour’s production, the Toronto Sun hailed the “sleek moving video screens, dramatic lights, [and] eye-catching imagery.”\n \nKings of Leon’s seventh studio album WALLS, released October 14 via RCA, marks the group’s first number one album in the U.S., debuting at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart as well as #1 on the Alternative Albums, Rock Albums, Top Albums Sales, and Top Digital Albums Charts.  The album received amazing critical acclaim upon its release, with The New York Times calling it “timeless,” Rolling Stone saying it’s “Kings of Leon at their best” and Consequence of Sound calling the album “their best album in years.” The album includes released tracks “Reverend,” “Around The World” and “WALLS” and their hit single “Waste A Moment,” which Stereogum said sounds like “the Kings Of Leon you remember.” The band will appear with a performance of “Reverend” off the new album tonight on Jimmy Kimmel Live! at 11:35/10:35c on ABC.\n \nKings of Leon has partnered with CID Entertainment to offer special fan experiences on the tour. Packages include premium concert tickets, a limited edition poster and exclusive access to the 'Seven WALLS Exhibit' with a gallery featuring Kings of Leon photos, memorabilia, awards and keepsakes.

His remarkable journey has seen him embrace folk, jazz, rock, and worldbeat styles while travelling to such far-flung places as Guatemala, Mali, Mozambique, and Nepal, and writing memorable songs about his ever-expanding world of wonders. “My job,” he explains, “is to try and trap the spirit of things in the scratches of pen on paper and the pulling of notes out of metal.”\n\nThat scratching and pulling has earned Cockburn high praise as an exceptional songwriter and a revered guitarist. His songs of romance, protest, and spiritual discovery are among the best to have emerged from Canada over the last 40 years. His guitar playing, both acoustic and electric, has placed him in the company of the world’s top instrumentalists. And he remains deeply respected for his activism on issues from native rights and land mines to the environment and Third World debt, working for organizations such as Oxfam, Amnesty International, Doctors Without Borders, and Friends of the Earth.\n\nThroughout his career, Cockburn has deftly captured the joy, pain, fear, and faith of human experience in song. Whether singing about retreating to the country or going up against chaos, tackling imperialist lies or embracing ecclesiastical truths, he has always expressed a tough yet hopeful stance: to kick at the darkness till it bleeds daylight. “We can’t settle for things as they are,” he once warned. “If you don’t tackle the problems, they’re going to get worse.”\n\nFor his many achievements, the Ottawa-born artist has been honoured with 12 Juno Awards, an induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame, and a Governor General’s Performing Arts Award, and has been made an Officer of the Order of Canada. But he never rests on his laurels. “I’d rather think about what I’m going to do next,” says Cockburn. “My models for graceful aging are guys like John Lee Hooker and Mississippi John Hurt, who never stop working till they drop, as I fully expect to be doing, and just getting better as musicians and as human beings.\n\nHis commitment to growth has made Bruce Cockburn both an exemplary citizen and a legendary artist whose prized songbook will be celebrated for many years to come.",

    "description": "JONNY LANG\nBOULDER THEATER\nSaturday, September 9, 2017\nDoors:  7:00 pm | Show:  8:00 pm\nTickets on sale 10 a.m. Friday, May 19, 2017 at bouldertheater.com. \n$32.50 ADV | $37.50 DOS plus applicable service charges\n\nSixteen years ago, at the age of 16, Jonny Lang found incredible success with the release of his major label debut album Lie To Me.  Fame does not seem to have impacted him from being the same country farm boy from Fargo, ND who got his start in the local clubs of Minneapolis.  He survived the passage of youth to adulthood, fell in love, began a family, and in the process passed through the life lessons we all endure.  He has a keen sense of what he aims to achieve creatively, what music means to him, and is focused on the impact that his songs bring to the lives of those that encounter his repertoire.  For Lang, with the release of Fight For My Soul, he is entering a chapter wherein he has found his true voice.\n\nWhen asked what he would tell his younger self if he was afforded the opportunity to share advise, he wisely answers, “I would say all of those voices steering you away from questionable decisions, listen to them.  They are right.”  He has encountered many in the public eye through his career that approaches two decades.  With those experiences, and the personality traits he has witnessed, he has a clarity of how he wants to be, and how he wants to treat others.\n\nThis sense of who he wants to be is the core of the album.  Lang shares, “The inspiration for the songs on the record vary widely.  Some are about personal struggles, some are focused on injustices I have seen.  Some are random fictional stories that hopefully can relate to people in some way that is a blessing to them.  I’ve wanted to make this album for a long time.  Creatively, I think there is a lot more going on inside of me than I’ve been sharing on recordings.”\n\nThe album defies categorization by a single genre.  The textured arrangements, broad worldview, gorgeous vocal melodies, and expressive guitar playing are what defines Fight For My Soul.  It is unequivocally what Lang aimed to achieve over the long period he has been working on reaching a realized vision.  He offers, “Much of what I’ve experienced through music and life in general is in these songs.  I really like reaching out and connecting with people.  For me, this is what it’s all about.  It keeps it fresh with different experiences every day.”\n\nJonnyLang_2757RealaLang has been working on the release for three years with Producer Tommy Sims, who co-wrote Eric Clapton’s Grammy winning “Change the World.”  The duo collaborated on the project from the ground up. The first step was fine-tuning the soulful numbers Lang demo’d at home.  He relates, “Sometimes I write music that I could never imagine putting on a record, and thanks to Tommy’s ability to see the continuity in these songs, where I might not have, they are on the album”.   Sims also brought in one number, the acoustic-electric soul-rocker “Blew Up (The House),” and played several instruments the album that include resonator guitar on that tune, and contributing world class bass guitar performances on select others.\n\nThis grass roots approach was new to Lang, whose four earlier studio albums were written and crafted under the watch of his previous record labels.  It was a welcome change. After Lang released his Grammy winning Turn Around in 2007, he made the decision to forego the major label route and became an independent artist. The first result was 2009’s Live At the Ryman, but Fight For My Soul, by its nature, is his first fully realized artistic achievement through his own label SayRai Music, featuring his own touring band: drummer Barry Alexander, bassist James Anton, rhythm guitarist Akil Thompson, keyboardist Dwan Hill and background vocalist Missi Hale.  “Recording with the band for the first time was really gratifying,” says Lang. “They’re all amazing musicians and we’ve grown together musically and personally by playing hundreds of live shows.”  This served us well in the making of Fight For My Soul.  Because of them, I have grown musically in ways I never thought I could, and it really is an honor to have them on this record.”\n\nJonnyLang_2386FujiRealaLang’s full touring schedule as well as making his family a priority in his life, are the primary cause for the length of commitment it took to deliver this album.  He reflects, “Between being with my family, and being out on the road touring, the last thing you want to do when home is to go and make a record.  We have had to pick our spots to fit in recording time.  In the last year, we’ve been able to work on it more consistently, and to finally wrap this thing up.” And with the delivery to label partners Mascot in Europe and Concord for North America, he achieved what he set out to deliver offering, “I’m really happy with the body of work we have for this one.  It’s kind of hard to be excited and know what the record was going to be like when the process is extended over such a long period of time.  Today sitting here I am really proud of the recordings.”\n\nAs an artist he has evolved since he began the writing process.  The sound of that evolution is all over Fight For My Soul. “What You’re Looking For” carefully layers banjo, guitars, spacey keyboards and a percussion sample to create a sonic dreamscape for its story of searching for life’s essentials — faith, love, hope. The arrangement of “We Are the Same” evokes the freewheeling spirit of Motown’s Psychedelic Shack era.\n\nJonny_Lang_2715The path Lang has been on has brought him the opportunity to interact with some of the most respected legends in music.  On the way up, he shared the stage with The Rolling Stones, B.B. King, Aerosmith, Sting, and Buddy Guy, who he continues to tour with today.  As a 12-year-old, he began a journey in Fargo, ND that has brought him to points across the Globe, and as he looks on the upcoming near-term future, he shares, “With this album, I really look forward to bringing our music to people in places where I’ve never been before.  Music is one of the greatest conveyers of ideas and emotions, and in a sense that doesn’t have as much to do with the individual performing, but the power of the connection.  One of my goals is the music can be a blessing to the people listening to it in some way.  And if Fight For My Soul can help somebody by making them feel better or that they’re not alone, that’s my idea of success for this album.”\n\n#FIGHTFORMYSOUL\n\nThe Lounge at The Boulder Theater is now open Tuesday – Saturday and on event nights from 5:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. The Lounge at the Boulder Theater specializes in locally sourced small plates, fine wines, craft cocktails and microbrews.

Though he never intended to be a live performer, there was little choice when the first song he ever wrote, \"Winter,\" was featured on an episode of \"Scrubs.\" The resulting fervor around the song soon led to a record deal, and over the last decade, Radin has toured the world countless times, sold hundreds of thousands of records and topped the iTunes charts, earned raves from Rolling Stone to The Guardian, performed on \"The Tonight Show,\" \"Conan,\" and more, played Ellen DeGeneres' wedding at her personal request, and had his songs featured in more than 150 different films, commercials, and TV shows.\n\nRadin, born in Cleveland and now living in Los Angeles, will be releasing a double live CD featuring all of his most popular songs. The recordings will be released in April 2016. \n\nAbout Rachael Yamagata \"Finally the heir to Bonnie Raitt.\" - Ann Powers, NPR Music\n\n\"Restoring female pop's good name.\" - Philadelphia Inquirer\n\"Rachael's voice is so soulful that it could inspire a tiger to chuff, an elephant to trumpet and whales to sing.\" - Gregory Colbert\nRachael Yamagata is not your ordinary singer/songwriter. Yes, she has released numerous albums; had record label deals; toured the world multiple times with sell-out concerts; built a loyal and ever-growing fan base; earned her place as a media 'darling'; made appearances on Jay Leno, Conan O'Brien, Carson Daly, \"30 Rock,\" \"One Life to Live\" and \"The O.C.\"; been an NPR profiled artist; made a cameo appearance as herself in Sony Pictures' To Write Love on Her Arms; had song placements in hit TV shows including \"NCIS: New Orleans,\" \"Vampire Diaries,\" \"Grey's Anatomy,\" \"Alias,\" \"How I Met Your Mother,\" and in and Hollywood movies including \"Hope Springs,\" \"Prime,\" \"Monster-in-Law,\" and \"Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants\"; been nominated Best Female Vocal by the Chicago Music Awards (2012); opened for artists including Patti Smith, David Gray, and Pete Townsend; and performed at venues including Madison Square Garden, Radio City Music Hall, Carnegie Hall, SXSW, Austin City Limits, Glastonbury, and Bonnaroo.\nBut there's so much more...\n\nRachael has performed with Bette Midler and Sheryl Crow at Senator Harry Reid's 2008 fundraiser for President Obama; at the White House Cherry Blossom Festival for First Lady Michelle Obama; twice at Deepak Chopra's Sages and Scientists Symposium; as part of the R.E.M. tribute concert; with Steve Earle and Allen Toussaint for the Woodie Guthrie tribute; collaborated with artists including Toots and the Maytals, Ryan Adams, Ray LaMontagne, Conor Oberst, Jason Mraz, and Katherine McPhee; and Australia's \"The Voice\" winner Karise Eden reached #1 with Rachael's song \"You Won't Let Me.\" She's toured with many of said artists, as well as The Swell Season, Sara Bareilles, Amos Lee, Liz Phair, and more. Rachael was invited by the White House to take part in its Official White House 'Tweet Up' in the West Wing with fans, and was one of Chopra's music playlist selections featured on Oprah Winfrey's website.\n\nArtist/filmmaker/photographer Gregory Colbert, best known for his acclaimed project \"Ashes and Snow\" which, to date, is the most attended solo exhibition by any living artist in history, asked Rachael to be a guest vocalist on his upcoming project.\nRachael and John Medeski (Medeski Martin & Wood) covered director Robert Altman song \"Let's Begin Again\" featured in the opening scene and end credits of the documentary, \"Altman\" (2014). Medeski said, \"Rachael blew my mind with her performance. She's a natural jazz singer.\"\n\nFans span the spectrum from 14-year-old girls to 65-year-old men, from spiritual healers, helicopter pilots, and military women, to hostage negotiators, heads of television networks, and single mothers. Rachael continually hears from fans that her music helped them through something in their life. Famed Korean photographer Jungman Kim calls Rachael 'his muse' and writer/journalist/ broadcaster Katherine Lanpher cites Rachael as the only twice invited guest of the Barnes & Nobel series, \"Upstairs at the Square\" (with novelist Alaa-Al-Aswany, \"The Yacoubian Building\" and Bill Clegg, \"Portrait of an Addict as a Young Man\" and \"90 Days\").\n\nOn the business front, Rachael was a guest speaker at 2013 Chicago Ideas Week, and profiled in two separate Topspin Berklee School of Music marketing classes with her Pledge Music DIY campaigns being used as part of the course curriculum.\nRachael breaks the mold of the singer/songwriter stereotype, and the DIY indie-artist model as, for the past four years she has be working without management representation.\n\nCD releases to date include \"Heavyweight\" EP (2012), \"Noisetrade Mixtape\" (2012), \"Chesapeake\" (2011), \"Elephants\" (2008), \"Loose Ends\" EP (2007), \"Live at the Loft\" (2005), \"Happenstance\" (2004), and \"Rachael Yamagata: EP\" (2001).\n\nHer latest album, currently titled \"Tightrope Walker,\" is slated for a fall 2015 release. It showcases her calling card ability to articulate humanity's struggles within relationships and the freedom that comes from celebrating that which we face alone and head on. The production is riskier and cinematic -- think Tom Waits meets Roberta Flack, Nick Cave hanging with Rufus Wainwright. Rachael confounds a labeled genre and instead embraces the production that serves the story. The paradox of her art mirrors that of her career and proves that we are never simplistic, but always full of surprises.\n\nThe Lounge at The Boulder Theater is now open Tuesday – Saturday and on event nights from 5:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. The Lounge at the Boulder Theater specializes in locally sourced small plates, fine wines, craft cocktails and microbrews.

Or the mimeograph revolution: what will DIY ethos and activities mean in the twenty-first century? What channels can we reenergize, and how do we send our work along the rhizome: the recording studio, the video-poem, the small press, the performance? And most crucially, we’ll press the issue of moving beyond the strictly cultural into solidarity with the ongoing revolutionary work of the Black Lives Matter movement, and the intervention of the Water Protectors at the Standing Rock Reservation. We’ll think critically about what forms of organizations and action are possible now: what sites/actions will help assemble a community ready to live in The New Weathers? what will energize these communities of survival and resistance? what is the hundred year plan for your life? \n  \nIn a lecture at a previous Summer Writing Program, Amiri Baraka charged the audience (and all of us, continuing): “I think as long as you’re principled, as long as you’re not trying to wipe anybody out, kill anybody—I’m talking about the world of literature and art—that you have to struggle above board and forthrightly to try to get a higher level of unity. That’s what I’ve always wanted. And I think if we can’t pass out of this world without leaving something of value, some kind of institution like a political party—‘cause when I say political party, all people think you mean is voting—political party has to do anything it has to do—you know, lead demonstrations, open museums, fight economically—it has to do anything it has to do, you know… DO SOMETHING.

Whereas Turner, the producer/drummer/keyboardist of the duo, finds solace in the minimal, bleak cable-patch squawks of Karlheinz Stockhausen and the analog-disco-thump of Giorgio Moroder, Behrens’ interests lie more along the lines of psychedelia, rock and various country and blues artists.\n\nThe result is a shimmering, pulsing pop music that is at once kinetically alive with Behrens’ striking vocals and driving guitar work but also anchored firmly by Turner’s percussive beats and Moog-generated melodies and hooks. Common descriptions include “electro-dance rock,” “synth-funk” and “Freddie Mercury-helms-Daft Punk.”\n\nDeciding to produce a style of music that as yet existed only in their collective consciousnesses; Behrens and Turner formed Ghostland Observatory in Austin in 2003 and haen’t looked back since. They now sell out prominent venues across the country, have played at Lollapalooza, Bonaroo, Coachella and the Austin City Limits music festival, which they headlined, and continue to play at various music festivals and venues around the globe to an ever increasing fan base, thanks to their now-famous live shows.\n\nThe duo has released four albums to date, all on Turner’s label, Trashy Moped Recordings: Delete.Delete.I.Eat.Meat..., Paparrazi Lightning, Robotique Majestique and their latest offering, Codename: Rondo, which was recorded in Turner’s Austin studio.\n\nThe ten-track Codename: Rondo is equal parts psyechedelia, minimal electronic, rock, funk and soul. It was recorded with what Turner calls a more “linear approach” in mind. Rather than layering sound upon sound to fill out a track, the band sought to use fewer sounds while striving to make each of them count.\n\nHighlights on the new album include the first track, “Glitter,” with its loping, fuzzed-out bassline, tremolo-tweaked vocals and Spaghetti Western guitar break. “That’s Right” is a Cars-meet-ZZ Top ripper with the former’s signature synth breaks skipping across the latter’s overdriven, chugging guitar riffs. Another standout, “Miracles,” finds Behrens haltingly phrasing his lyrics in perfect syncopation with Turner’s raw keyboard melody before exploding into an irresistible, hand-clapping chorus that is soon chased by running swells of disco strings. “Codename: Rondo,” the album’s title track, is a perfect example of the band’s efforts toward minimal maximization: a surreal narrative recalling a series of nebulous incidents in Newark, New Jersey spoken over nothing more than a steady kick and some faint electronic warbling while, during the breakdown, deep space satellite transmissions blip intermittently over a loop of what seems to be a robot with hiccups and poor phone reception attempting to leave a voicemail.\n\nWith Codename: Rondo, Ghostland Observatory has taken a step in a new direction, both creatively and technically, while still maintaining the essential elements of their unmistakable sound: “sweaty, raw-boned, and direct from the future; committed to electronics, stuck on big beats, yet unmistakably powered by rock ‘n’ roll.”\n\n \nFor more information about this show, please contact\nDarlene D’Agostino Beck at Darlene@z2ent.com.\nTickets are on sale at Boulder Theater Box Office, by phone at (303)-786-7030 or online at www.bouldertheater.com\n \nThe Lounge at The Boulder Theater is now open Tuesday – Saturday and on event nights from 5:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. The Lounge at the Boulder Theater specializes in locally sourced small plates, fine wines, craft cocktails and microbrews.

Like most of their peers, they were distinguished by their hyperkinetic stage shows, juvenile humor, ironic covers of new wave pop songs, and metallic shards of ska. The group cultivated an underground following that broke into the mainstream in summer 1997, when the single \"Sell Out\" became a modern rock radio and MTV favorite. Reel Big Fish's popularity gradually waned in the subsequent years, following the decline of ska-punk as a marketable genre. Nevertheless, the band restructured its lineup and continued issuing new material to a smaller (yet considerably rabid) fan base. Based in Huntington Beach, California, Reel Big Fish were originally a trio comprised of vocalist/guitarist Aaron Barrett, bassist Matt Wong, and drummer Andrew Gonzales. At that stage, the group was a conventional rock band with pop-metal leanings that covered both classic rock and Top 40 songs --essentially, it was music designed for frat parties. After several months, the band discovered ska and decided to bolster its lineup with the addition of horn players. Reel Big Fish had a difficult time maintaining a stable horn section, and it took several years before their final lineup -- featuring Tavis Werts (trumpet), Scott Klopfenstein (trumpet, vocals), Grant Barry (trombone), and Dan Regan (trombone) -- fell into place. Everything Sucks This definitive incarnation of Reel Big Fish recorded its self-released debut album, Everything Sucks, in 1995. Everything Sucks became a word-of-mouth underground hit in ska-punk and college circles, which gave the band enough leverage to sign with the indie label Mojo Records. The label's president, Jay Rifkin, and former Oingo Boingo bassist John Avila co-produced Turn the Radio Off, which marked the band's first album for Mojo. Turn the Radio Off was unleashed in August 1996, and over the next year, Reel Big Fish continually toured in support of the album's release, expanding their fan base all the while. In spring 1997, the single \"Sell Out\" began receiving heavy airplay from several influential modern rock stations in the U.S., which soon translated into MTV support for the song's quirky video. By summer, the song had become a moderate modern rock hit, and the album had charted in the Top 100. In July 1997, Reel Big Fish released the Keep Your Receipt EP, which contained \"Sell Out\" and several outtakes, new songs, and live cuts. Why Do They Rock So Hard followed a year later, and in early 2000 the band returned with a reissued version of Everything Sucks. Cheer Up! \n\nThe guys wound up on Jive Records in fall 2001 when their current label, Mojo, was bought by Jive's parent label, Zomba. Reel Big Fish's first release for Jive, a rock-oriented record entitled Cheer Up!, appeared in mid-2002. Years of touring followed, during which the band shared stages with the likes of Sum 41, Catch 22, Lucky Boys Confusion, the Matches, and Zebrahead. Replacement drummer Carlos de la Garza (formerly of Suburban Rhythm) eventually decided to leave the lineup, and his last show with the group was recorded live at Anaheim's House of Blues in June 2003. A DVD of that performance, The Show Must Go Off!, was released by the end of the year, and the band's next album, the cynical yet catchy We're Not Happy 'Til You're Not Happy, was issued in April 2005. By this time, the group's lineup had shifted to include Barrett, Regan, Klopfenstein, Wong, new trumpeter John Christianson, and drummer Justin Ferreira (who was later replaced by Ryland Steen). Our Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album Touring continued for the rest of the year, and Reel Big Fish happily parted ways with Jive in January 2006, having wished to be dropped from the label since Cheer Up!'s release. A co-headlining tour with MxPx followed that summer, allowing Reel Big Fish the chance to gain their footing as an independent band. In August, the group self-released a double-disc live CD (along with an accompanying DVD) titled Our Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album. A few months later -- and much to the annoyance of the band -- Jive issued its own Reel Big Fish album, a best-of compilation entitled Greatest Hit...and More. Reel Big Fish received no money from the album's sales, as Jive Records now owned the rights to the bulk of their songs. Duet All Night Long Nevertheless, Reel Big Fish returned with some new material in February 2007, splitting an EP (Duet All Night Long) with their friends in Zolof the Rock & Roll Destroyer. Monkeys for Nothin' and the Chimps for Free followed several months later, marking the group's first full-length studio release since leaving Jive's roster, and 2009's Fame, Fortune and Fornication found the band covering songs by the likes of Poison, Slade, and Tom Petty. In 2011, longtime member Scott Klopfenstein left Reel Big Fish to focus on raising a family, with Goldfinger's Matt Appleton taking over for him. The following year, the band released its first album of new material in five years, Candy Coated Fury.\n\nFor more information about this show, please contact \nDarlene D’Agostino Beck at Darlene@z2ent.com. \nTickets are on sale at Boulder Theater Box Office, by phone at (303)-786-7030 or online at www.bouldertheater.com\n\nThe Lounge at The Boulder Theater is now open Tuesday – Saturday and on event nights from 5:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. The Lounge at the Boulder Theater specializes in locally sourced small plates, fine wines, craft cocktails and microbrews.

    "description": "“Neva Romero: Jamas Olvidados”, is a documentary film about a 21-year-old University of Colorado undergraduate who was killed, along with two other Chicano activists, in a car bomb in May of 1974 at the Colorado Chautauqua. Forty-eight hours later another car bomb rocked the Boulder community, killing three more Chicano activists elsewhere in Boulder. The events of these two nights forever altered the Chicano Rights Movement and the questions surrounding their deaths have never been answered. No one was ever convicted. “Neva Romero: Jamas Olvidados,” is the story of a group of committed young activists working toward social justice, and one young woman’s struggle to make a difference during a period of collective turmoil.\n \nDirector Nicole Esquibel will give an introduction as well conduct a talkback after the screening. \n \nA portion of tonight’s proceeds will benefit the Neva Arlene Romero Scholarship Fund.",

Billy, in one-man Clash mode, will perform songs from his 30+ year career, some pertinent covers by his heroes and mentors and some freshly minted songs about the state of the world.\n \nBilly Bragg has been a fearless recording artist, tireless live performer and peerless political campaigner for over 30 years. Among the former Saturday boy’s albums are his punk-charged debut Life’s a Riot With Spy Vs Spy, the more love-infused Workers Playtime, pop classic Don’t Try This At Home, the Queen’s Golden Jubilee-timed treatise on national identity England, Half-English, and his stripped-down tenth, Tooth & Nail, his most successful since the early 90s. The intervening three decades have been marked by a number one hit single, having a street named after him, being the subject of a South Bank Show, appearing onstage at Wembley Stadium, curating Left Field at Glastonbury, sharing spotted dick with a Cabinet minister in the House of Commons cafeteria, being mentioned in Bob Dylan’s memoir and meeting the Queen. At their best, Billy’s songs present ‘the perfect Venn diagram between the political and the personal’ (the Guardian).\n \nThe Lounge at The Boulder Theater is now open Tuesday – Saturday and on event nights from 5:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. The Lounge at the Boulder Theater specializes in locally sourced small plates, fine wines, craft cocktails and microbrews. Give us a call at 303. 998.9350 or send us an email at lounge@z2ent.com.",

While Hull’s ethereal voice and fluid playing take center stage here, she receives ample support from bass marvel Ethan Jodziewicz. Béla Fleck’s banjo adorns the elegant “Queen of Hearts/Royal Tea,” and Alison Krauss, Abigail Washburn, and Rhiannon Giddens add enchanting harmonies.\n\nThough she is best known for her work as a mandolin player, Hull reveals in these songs her abundant gifts as a composer and lyricist. Themes of loss and restoration run through the album, starting with the muscular opening number, “Stranded,” and continue on the stirring “Compass,” on which she declares, “I’ve thrown away my compass, done with the chart... I’ll just step out, throw my doubt into the sea, for what’s meant to be will be.” The gentle, dissonant title track ponders existential questions, while the haunting “Birthday” and “Fallen Man” offer somber reflections on strained relationships and impossible choices. The album closes on an optimistic note, with the sweetly assertive “I’ll Be Fine,” and the uplifting, philosophical closer, “Black River.” Fleck, Giddens, Krauss, and Washburn all guest on this track, on which Hull reflects, “A thousand years is but a day, and maybe in a thousand years, I’ll find my way.”",

Boulder Theater performance on Saturday, August 12th. http://www.bouldertheater.com/event/1433521-twiddle-red-rocks-ticket-boulder/\n\nTWIDDLE\nWith roots at Vermont’s Castleton State University, Twiddle began their extensive touring career in 2005. Over a decade later, the foursome has composed an eclectic catalogue spanning three studio albums of originals, in addition to many live releases. Currently the band is digging in at the studio composing PLUMP Chapter Two, the second half of their acclaimed third album. Having performed at a multitude of international festivals, Twiddle’s trajectory shows zero sign of slowing. Look for them to pack prominent theaters throughout 2016, as they truly break through to the next level.\n\nhttp://twiddlemusic.com/\n\nMOE. is the preeminent progressive rock band on the music scene today—a quintet of world class musicians, whose creative output equals that of their longevity. In a remarkable career that has touched three decades and produced a discography of 24 albums, the Sugar Hill Records recording artist of Al Schnier and Chuck Garvey on guitars and vocals, Rob Derhak on bass and vocals, Jim Loughlin on percussion and vibes, and Vinnie Amico on drums, continue to push the standard for performance art higher and further.\n\nWhether touring around the globe, headlining music festivals, or sharing the stage with such diverse acts as the Allman Brothers, Dave Matthews Band, The Who, Robert Plant, Government Mule, or Blues Traveler, among many others, what keeps moe. at the forefront of the music scene is not only the energy and vitality of their music and songwriting, but the showmanship in which it is delivered. Their music is clever, melodic, refined, filled with \"ferocious guitar riffs\" and \"intricate rhythms\" (Relix); their performances are entertaining, mesmerizing, and epic.\n\nFrom their humble, inconspicuous beginnings as a local bar band in Buffalo, NY, to headlining Radio City Music Hall on New Year's Eve, moe.'s journey has been one of hard work, perseverance, and dedication. Critical acclaim and a solid national and international fan base has resulted in a dedicated following that grows each year. Rolling Stone magazine named Chuck and Al among the top twenty new \"guitar gods,\" The pair have been featured in Guitar World and Modern Guitar, Jim and Vinnie in Drum!, and Rob in Bass Player. The renowned guitar play between Al and Chuck has become the stuff of legend. The exceptional vibe and percussion work by Jim is brilliant. The understated bass play by Rob is masterful. The seamless, efficiency of Vinnie's drumming is extraordinary. Together, the five create a musical synergy greater than the sum of their parts.\n\nThe news about moe. keeps getting better, too, in the studio and on tour. A new album, their second on Sugar Hill Records, is set for a 2014 release. It follows the critically acclaimed 2012 release, What Happened To The LA LAs, and the 2010 Smash Hits, Volume One—a rerecording of some of moe.'s most endearing classics. The band's tour schedule is extensive, playing in venues, intimate and grand, from NYC to LA, San Fran to Atlanta, Chi Town to Bean Town, from Tokyo to Toronto, and across the Atlantic to Paris, Amsterdam, London, Hamburg, and Milano. Long a featured act at music festivals, they've performed and headlined at the likes of Bonnaroo, All Good, and High Sierra, in the US, and Fuji Rock Festival in Japan, and Burg Herzberg in Germany, to name a few; yet made time to promote and perform at their own festivals—Summer Camp, Snoe.down, and moe.down.\n\nBy all accounts, for this \"legendary jam band,\" as Rolling Stone described them, moe. represents rock and roll at its best. Welcome news for the moe. faithful and the band's ever-expanding fan base. Even better news for the world of rock and roll, for moe. is just hitting their creative stride.\n\nhttp://www.moe.org/",

The widow Dona Blair liked ‘the idea of me’ and so carried the note, which was a good thing because any bank would have laughed in my face. I bought the ranch for its unspeakable beauty and, if I am being perfectly honest, for the adrenaline rush buying it brought on. Little did I know that was the beginning of far and away the most successful love story of my life in terms of both longevity and lessons learned.  My forthcoming book, ‘Some Kind Of Calling,’ is the story of all the ways the ranch challenged me, schooled me, healed me, held me and made me who I am. “– Pam Houston \n\nAbout the Author: \n\nPam Houston’s most recent book is “Contents May Have Shifted,” published in 2012.

After five genre-defining studio albums, Pixies disbanded in 1993, and then launched their reunion tour in April 2004, playing to sell-out crowds all over the globe for seven years, a longer period of time than they were a band originally. But writing, recording and releasing new music was something that the band had been wanting to do for a long time, so they secretly booked studio time in Wales for the fall of 2012. Six days into the recording, founding bassist Kim Deal decided to leave the band; Black Francis, Joey Santiago and David Lovering made the decision to carry on, working with a variety of touring bassists, something they'd never done.\n \nThe band surprised everyone with \"Bagboy\" (June 28, 2013) and then, 10 months after, with Indie Cindy (April 29, 2014), their first new album in more than twenty years. Over that time period, the band also released three EPs, as well as 10 music videos, racking up nearly 5-million views. Since they kicked off their 2013 - 2015 global tour in September, 2013, the band has played 120 shows across four continents, and still have lots of touring ahead of them.\nAs the UK's DIY wrote about the new music, \"They're back. They're still brilliant. God save the Pixies.\"\n \nThe Lounge at the Boulder Theater is now open Tuesday – Saturday and on event nights from 5:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. The Lounge at the Boulder Theater specializes in locally sourced small plates, fine wines, craft cocktails and microbrews.

    "description": "Dr. Edgar Mitchell, along with eleven other Apollo moonwalkers during six historic moon missions (July 1969 to December 1972), helped change our perceptions of Earth. Suddenly, it was possible for humans to leave our planet and walk on a different heavenly body. Edgar Mitchell was the Lunar Module Pilot for the Apollo 14 flight that lasted from January 31, 1971 to February 9, 1971. He traveled to the moon with Commander Alan Shepard and Command Module Pilot Stuart Roosa. Mitchell and Shepard walked on the lunar surface for nearly nine hours over two days. They completed many science experiments, collected nearly one hundred pounds of moon rocks, and are on record for the longest moonwalk on foot of any Apollo astronaut. On return to Earth in the spacecraft, Mitchell had a transcendent “Samadhi in space” that forever changed his life and was integral in his founding of the renowned Institute of Noetic Sciences. \n\nAbout the Author: \n\nEllen Mahoney is a journalist, educator and author with a focus on writing nonfiction. She holds a Bachelor of Science in Journalism and Human Development from Syracuse University, and a Master of Science in Education from USC. Ellen is the author of \"Nellie Bly and Investigative Journalism for Kids\" published in 2015 by Chicago Review Press. In addition, she is the co-author, with the late Dr. Edgar Mitchell, of \"Earthrise: My Adventures as an Apollo 14 Astronaut.\" Ellen teaches in the Department of Journalism & Technical Communication at Metropolitan State University of Denver. Previously, she taught writing at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and through the Lifelong Learning program with the Boulder Valley School District.",

    "description": "From the best-selling author of “The Dog Stars and The Painter,” a luminous, masterful novel of suspense–the story of Celine, an elegant, aristocratic private eye who specializes in reuniting families, trying to make amends for a loss in her own past.\n\nWorking out of her jewel box of an apartment at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge, Celine has made a career of tracking down missing persons, and she has a better record at it than the FBI. But when a young woman, Gabriela, asks for her help, a world of mystery and sorrow opens up. Gabriela’s father was a photographer who went missing on the border of Montana and Wyoming. He was assumed to have died from a grizzly mauling, but his body was never found. Now, as Celine and her partner head to Yellowstone National Park, investigating a trail gone cold, it becomes clear that they are being followed–that this is a case someone desperately wants to keep closed. Combining the exquisite plotting and gorgeous evocation of nature that have become his hallmark, with a wildly engrossing story of family, privilege, and childhood loss, Peter Heller gives us his finest work to date.\n\nAbout the Author: \n\nPeter Heller is the best-selling author of “The Painter” and “The Dog Stars.” An award-winning adventure writer and a longtime contributor to NPR, Heller is a contributing editor at Outside magazine, Men's Journal and National Geographic Adventure, and a regular contributor to Bloomberg Businessweek. He is also the author of several nonfiction books, including “Kook,” “The Whale Warriors” and “Hell or High Water: Surviving Tibet's Tsangpo River.” He lives in Denver, Colorado.",

    "category": "MUSIC_EVENT",
    "description": "An Evening With Greensky Bluegrass at Boulder Theater\n\nDOORS: 7:30pm\nSHOW: 8:30pm\n$72.50 2-DAY W/ RED ROCKS | $110 RED ROCKS VIP + GA BT | $35 DOS\t\nAll Ages\n\nGreensky Bluegrass is Anders Beck (dobro), Michael Arlen Bont (banjo), Dave Bruzza (guitar), Mike Devol (upright bass) and Paul Hoffman (mandolin).\n\n“There’s this great duality to our band,” reflects Greensky Bluegrass mandolinist, vocalist, and songwriter Paul Hoffman. “We’re existing in a few different places at once: we’re a bluegrass band and a rock band, we’re song-driven and interested in extended improvisation.”\n\n“We play acoustic instruments,” adds dobro player Anders Beck, “but we put on a rock’n’roll show. We play in bigger clubs and theaters, there’s a killer light show, and we’re as loud as your favorite rock band. It’s not easy to make five acoustic instruments sound like this – it’s something we’ve spent years working on.”\n\nFrom these seemingly irreconcilable elements, the five members of Greensky Bluegrass have forged a defiant, powerful sound that, while rooted in classic string band Americana, extends outwards with a fearless, exploratory zeal. The tension and release between these components – tradition and innovation, prearranged songs and improvisation, acoustic tones and electric volume – is what makes them so thrillingly dynamic, in concert and on record. “In theory,” Hoffman explains, “greensky is the complete opposite of bluegrass. So, by definition, we are contrasting everything that isn’t bluegrass with everything that is.”\n\nThat their sound is so seamless, so organic, is testament to Greensky’s enduring vision and tireless dedication. Since their first rumblings at the start of the millennium, they have emerged as relentless road warriors, creating a captivating live show while at the same time developing a knack for evocative, disarming songcraft.\n\nTheir fifth studio album, If Sorrows Swim – available September 9, 2014 and distributed by Thirty Tigers – is their most riveting yet, balancing gripping songs (by Hoffman and guitarist Dave Bruzza) and remarkably thoughtful, tight arrangements with an instrumental fluidity born of countless hours playing together – on stage and off.\n\nFrom their unlikely base of Kalamazoo, Michigan (home of the original Gibson Mandolin-Guitar factory), Greensky – which also includes banjoist Michael Arlen Bont and bassist Michael Devol – arrived at their unique take on the bluegrass tradition by working from the outside inward. “I found bluegrass through the back door,” Beck says, “through the Jerry Garcia route. That’s how I got to listening to Bill Monroe and Earl Scruggs. It’s really interesting how many people in our generation got into acoustic music through that channel.”\n\nApproaching their instruments from an open-ended, rock perspective gave them the freedom to create their own rules. “We were always coming at bluegrass backwards,” Hoffman says. “We were better musicians than we were bluegrass musicians. I mean, I didn’t buy a mandolin until I was 18. Dave didn’t start playing acoustic guitar until he was 18. Bont got a banjo when he was 20. We discovered that, when it came to learning these instruments, we preferred to do so by improvising and writing our own songs, instead playing standard material and fiddle tunes.”\n\nThe roots of Greensky Bluegrass lay in the friendship of Bruzza and Bont. While nurturing a nascent interest in acoustic music, they were joined by Hoffman. The trio shedded intently, playing informally in living rooms and at open mics for years before setting out as a band. Devol, a classically trained cellist, was added in the fall of 2004, and in 2006 Greensky Bluegrass won the coveted band contest at Colorado’s forward-thinking Telluride Bluegrass Festival. At that point, the members dedicated themselves to Greensky full-time and began widening their touring radius. In 2007, dobroist Beck came aboard. From the sidelines, he was quick to pinpoint the band’s appeal. “It was all about the songs,” he says. “You can be the best pickers in the world or the most educated musicians, but, all in all, the things that connect with people are songs, lyrics, and melodies. That was the real kicker.”\n\nBy playing up to 175 shows a year, mostly in rock clubs and more open-minded festivals like Telluride, Austin City Limits, Bonnaroo, and the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, Greensky Bluegrass became a word-of-mouth underground sensation, cultivating a devoted legion of fans entranced both by the band’s improvisational acumen and the quality of their songwriting. Then and now, despite their wide-ranging musical interests, Greensky continues to work within the structure of a classic five-man stringband. “The cool thing about a bluegrass band or, really, any drummerless band,” Hoffman explains, “is that it’s like acoustic chamber music — challenging, exciting, and fun to play.”\n\n“While there are potential limitations because of our instrumentation,” Beck adds, “a really big part of what is Greensky Bluegrass is about is to essentially ignore those limitations.”\n\nThe depth and sophistication of the band’s interplay is showcased throughout If Sorrows Swim, across a program of stirring, resonant original songs. Recorded over ten days, the album was tracked to two-inch tape. “The decision to use tape over digital recording is basically the decision to use less,” Hoffman explains. “It’s not about everything being perfect, it’s about capturing a moment in time.\" The album mixes previously unrecorded, road-tested concert staples with new material carefully honed with the sort of razor’s edge focus that the recording studio inspires.\n\nIf Sorrows Swim opens with “Windshield,” a haunting rumination that slowly builds in emotional and musical intensity around an insistent pulse from the bass. The desperation in Hoffman’s increasingly anguished vocal is slowly surrounded by churning rhythm guitar and incessant banjo before the tension is dispersed by a plaintive dobro solo. A brooding cello line deep in the mix adds an ominous undercurrent, and underpins the group’s swirling counterpoint as the track fades.\n\nThe album’s title derives from “Burn Them,” a minor key reflection set to a more straight-ahead, driving bluegrass rhythm. “There was something on This American Life,” Hoffman recalls. “Someone was talking about just how upset and sad they were. They were drinking a lot, but they just couldn’t drink that pain away. When I heard that, I thought to myself, ‘What if sorrows swim?’ I couldn’t get that thought out of my mind.” Tightly orchestrated, the performance is marked by ingenious touches. \n\nThe transitions between the guitar and mandolin solos are delineated by a quick unison passage played by both instruments, and Bont contributes an especially nimble, melodic break.\n\nHaving two distinct songwriting voices further enriches If Sorrows Swim, with Bruzza contributing a quartet of varied, insightful songs featuring his burnished, soulful vocals. “Worried About the Weather” moves between a swinging half-time feel and a breezier, bluegrass tempo – reinforcing the contrast between relief and uncertainty embodied in the lyric. Bruzza’s brisk “Kerosene” features some of the album’s more daring improvisational passages, and highlights the band’s gift for electrically processing their acoustic instruments to emphasize the emotion behind their playing. Hoffman’s mandolin solo is colored by subtle delay, while Bruzza’s spacious, inquisitive break finds him employing a slightly distorted tone to further escalate the song’s intensity.\n\n“What makes this album different from the last,” Hoffman explains, referring to 2011’s accomplished Handguns, “is that we paid so much more attention to what the song needs. At every juncture, we would ask, ‘Does it serve the song?’ We ask that a lot.” Throughout If Sorrows Swim, Greensky’s playing and arrangements are impressively intricate – and showcased in a rich, spacious sound that lets each note and accent sing and decay as if in slow motion.\n\nThe taxing yet rewarding process of recording now behind them, Greensky Bluegrass is anxious to unveil If Sorrows Swim’s unheard material in concert. “The live experience is this springboard,” Beck muses. “You just see what happens.\nWhen you’re improvising every night and taking risks, it becomes a very circular thing with the audience — the audience feeds off the energy of the band and the band feeds off the energy of the audience and it becomes a much bigger thing.”\n\nWith the release of their first nationally distributed album and a busy touring season ahead of them, Greensky Bluegrass are facing a new level of exposure. It’s a challenge they are up to, that they embrace. As their music and their audience has grown, so have they, and their sites are set ever-higher.\n\n“When we were doing our first shows and making those early records,” Hoffman concludes, “it was stressful because we wanted to hit the right notes. We just wanted it to be good enough. But now, we want it to be great.”",

After spending several years working comedy clubs across the country, Breuer settled in as a regular on the New York comedy club circuit. After being in New York for only seven months, Breuer landed a gig on the nationally syndicated show, “Uptown Comedy Club,” where he spent two seasons. Later he appeared on ABC’s “Home Improvement” starring funny man Tim Allen, before making his big break which came in 1995 when he joined the cast of NBC’s legendary “Saturday Night Live.” During his four years on SNL, Breuer quickly became a fan-favorite for his original character “Goat Boy” and his dead-on impressions of actor Joe Pesci.\n\nFollowing his success on SNL, Breuer starred alongside Dave Chappelle in the cult favorite film “Half Baked.” He has since appeared in the popular films “Zookeeper,” “Dick,” “Titan A.E.” and “Beer League.” On the small screen, Breuer hosted MTV's popular “Beach House” and VH1’s “Web Junk 20.” His other television appearances include “Kevin Can Wait,” “This Is Not Happening,” “Late Night with Conan O’Brien,” “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,” “The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson,” “Jimmy Kimmel Live,” “Late Night with Jimmy Fallon,” and “The Marriage Ref.” Breuer is also a frequent guest on the Howard Stern Show.\n\nIn 2008, Breuer set out for his \"Breuniversity Tour\" with his 85-year-old father and a film crew. The footage that was captured blended together to create “The Jim Breuer Road Journals,\" which showcased what life is like on the road with a comedian and his father. Videos from that tour also sparked the making of his documentary “More Than Me,” which was shown at the 2009 Montreal Film Festival. In July of 2009, Breuer’s one-hour Comedy Central special “Let's Clear the Air” premiered with hilarious topics that included what \"success\" really is, his SNL days and life with his elderly parents, his wife and his three daughters. In 2011, Breuer embarked on a national tour with three of the country’s top comedians, Dave Attell, Bill Burr, and Jim Norton, for \"The Anti-Social Network\" tour. That same year, Breuer's acclaimed autobiography, “I’m Not High: (But I've Got a Lot of Crazy Stories about Life as a Goat Boy, a Dad, and a Spiritual Warrior),” was released on paperback. In the memoir, Breuer sheds light on his early struggles, his rise to fame and the many lessons he’s learned along in an extremely funny, yet personal and touching way that fans have never seen before. In 2015, Breuer released his all new one hour comedy special on EPIX, “Jim Breuer: Comic Frenzy.” The latest special focuses on what Breuer’s life (and all of our lives) truly consist of: dealing with the elderly, becoming our parents’ caretakers, parenting teenagers, and what it takes to be a “marriage warrior.” Breuer recently released his debut Metal album “Songs From The Garage” on May 27 with his new band “Jim Breuer and The Loud & Rowdy” through Metal Blade Records. \n\nThroughout the years, Breuer has supported various charities through his comedy, including the Chris Farley Foundation, MusiCares, his local police and fire departments and more. Breuer currently resides in New Jersey where he enjoys spending time with his family, playing pick-up games of baseball, softball and wiffle ball and watching the NY Mets.",

It was down those mean streets that Steve had spent his famous “hiatus” in the early 1990’s mostly shooting dope. It was a crazy, unprecedented thing. Here was a guy – the supposed “new face” of outlaw country – who had already put out a near unbroken string of instant classics, including chart hits like “Guitar Town,” “Someday,” and the immortal “Copperhead Road.” And he just up and disappears, drops from sight for four years, making no records, playing no shows. Many thought he was dead. By the time we met, Steve was on the way back, through his sixty-day stint in the Davidson County Jail, firmly in recovery. He’d already released a couple new discs, the masterly acoustic Train A Comin’ and the defiantly electric I Feel Alright. But you could tell, he wasn’t all the way back. Clean and sober can be a transitory thing, the ghosts of the old days are far from fully vanquished, if they ever will be. Steve wasn’t sure he wanted any more of South Nashville, but being Steve, which is to be an adventurer and a sport, he agreed to take the tour.\n\n“This is Lewis Street,” Steve said as we turned right off Fain. The neighborhood hadn’t changed all that much since Steve holed up there, listening to Dr. Dre’s The Chronic on a near permanent loop. A number of local denizens were killing time on the corner, craning their heads to see if these particular white boys were buyers or cops. But I was already familiar with Lewis Street from the tune “South Nashville Blues,” which appears on I Feel Alright.\n\n“The Devil lives on Lewis Street, I swear, I seen him rocking in his rocking chair,” the song goes, prefaced by one of the hundred or so all-time great Steve Earle lines, “I took my pistol and a hundred dollar bill, I had everything I needed to get me killed.” A bit of old-timey shuffle, “South Nashville Blues” was very definitely a blues song. This was a little unusual, Steve told me back in 1996. “Because I don’t play a lot of blues tunes. I don’t think I’m really that good at them.”\n\nThis is a perhaps not so roundabout way to getting to Steve Earle’s newest collection of songs, the sixteenth studio album of his singular career. It is called Terraplane, and as those familiar with the Robert Johnson song should know, it is very much a blues album, a very good, typically heartfelt blues album.\n\n“I’ve gotten a lot better at playing blues since then,” Steve told me the other day, as we sat in the Greenwich Village apartment where he’s lived for the past several years since moving to New York. He had to get better, Steve said, because if you grew up in Texas during the 1960’s and 70’s playing blues is a serious matter. The bar, Steve said, “is very high.”\n\nIt is always fun to sit around and talk about music with Steve Earle. You may need a crowbar to get a word in edgewise once SE gets rolling, but he does tend to say some interesting stuff. In this case he explained that, as far as he knew from his own travels and such compatriots as his great inspiration Townes Van Zandt, Guy Clark, and 1,000 bar room pickers, there were two epicenters of Texas blues in the pre-Led Zep days.\n\n“There was Fort Worth where the model was Freddy King, and there was the Houston scene which was dominated by Lightnin’ Hopkins. Two very different styles,” Steve reported. Steve saw both of these giants, but mostly received their message as channeled through the soul of some of the most formidable synthesizers in pop history. “Johnny Winter, Jimmy and Stevie Vaughn, Canned Heat. Billy Gibbons.\n\nBilly fucking Gibbons. He’s a monster, always was. He’d do Lightnin’ but really loud.” Steve said. “These were people we heard at that time and there was no doubt it was the real thing – you can never tell me Bob Hite was not a bluesman.” This was all well and good, especially since Steve’s guitar player, Chris Masterson, raised on that same Texas soil, can really kick the shit out of the stuff. But the question was, why now? Why was Steve making a blues record now?\n\nSteve twirled at the fringes of his beard. He got that sort of cramped accusative tone and asked, “you saying I made a blues record because I’m getting divorced?”\n\n“Well, that’s what everyone is going to think.” Steve’s voice rose. “I know that’s what they’ll think! And they won’t be wrong…but it is a little more complicated than that.”\n\nThis was, of course quite true. When you’ve been married seven different times to six different women, that’s some Chinese math right there. The odd thing is that out of the dozens of tremendous tunes Steve Earle has written over the past 35 years very few have been break-up songs. Asked about it, Steve couldn’t even think of one himself. “I don’t want to waste songs on girls that are going. I’d rather save them for girls that are coming,” he said.\n\nIn matters of the heart, Steve Earle has always been an optimist. There are several better-known tunes on the “Guitar Town” album, but when it comes to young(er) love all you really need is “Fearless Heart.” With Whitmanesque exaltation of his own resiliency, the singer sings: “I got me a fearless heart/ strong enough to get you through the scary part/ its been broken many times before/ a fearless heart just comes back for more.” Whatever happens, he’ll bounce back; all previous failures are only recon so as to guide\nHis Own True Love Of the Moment across the “scary part.” Back then, Steve had faith in his ability to fall in love again, no matter what. It was a strange dichotomy. With an unmatched talent to describe the heartbreaking (as with the doomed Billy Austin, “twenty-nine years old, quarter Cherokee I’m told”) the singer largely avoided his own heartbreak.\n\nSo what’s different now? Why have we suddenly been given a sardonic if playful kiss-off number like “Go Go Boots Are Back Again,” which might be Steve’s “Leopard Skin Pill Box Hat.\" The same question could be asked about an elegiac shuffle like “Best Lover I Ever Had,” with its sexually-charged lament, “never had another kiss taste like that/you’re the best lover I ever had.” And what can be made of “Better Off Alone,” a mournful cry of the newly adrift that Steve says represents “completely unchartered territory for me, and probably the best song on the record partially for that reason.”\n\n“Everyone talks about how many times I’ve been married. They don’t talk about how many times I’ve been divorced, maybe that’s what this record is about,” Steve remarked.\n\n“I mean, I thought I had it pretty much licked. I had a little bit of money in the bank for the first in my life. I’d been married for longer than I ever had been. Allison (his last wife, singer Allison Moorer) and I were together for eight and a half years. None of my other marriages had lasted more than three or four.\n\nWe had this great little kid. I thought, okay this is how it is supposed to be. It was the only time I’d ever married when I was sober. Those other marriages were in the 80’s when I was using. After that, I lived with people but I didn’t marry them. I didn’t think I was ready. Then, I thought I was and it didn’t work out.”\n\n“I knew I’d make a blues record back when I was doing the Low Highway. Fucking weird, doing the sessions of that record – Allison’s on it but we were really coming apart. After that, I spent a long time on the road, a lot of time by myself. I wrote a third of Terraplane on tour in Europe, five weeks traveling around alone with just a guitar, a mandolin and backpack. I needed to be by myself and I needed to see if I could do it. Songs like `Better Off Alone’ came out of that.”\n\n“I’m still alone, so I’m thinking maybe that’s just the way its gonna be for me. I’m still an optimist but like I don’t have a lot of optimism about current politics, maybe I have less about relationships. That’s what I’m telling myself right now, anyway. I’m feeling pressed for time. I’m going to be sixty years old.\n\nI’ve got a four-year-old son. I have no idea how things are going to turn out for him. I have to make sure he’s kind of set up. My father died when he was 74. I’ll probably outlive him but you know, you just want to make it all count.”\n\n“I’m patient, but I’m focused. There’s a lot to do. I’d like to write a musical, I’m working on a country record. I think a lot people this age feel like this. And if there’s one thing I know about songwriting, it doesn’t matter if it’s a love song, a song for my kid, or about an issue, something I saw on TV – people don’t give a fuck what I think about it, what they do give a fuck about is what experiences we have in common. As a songwriter, that’s where I want to go, to touch that place between me and you.”\n\nThen, simply because Steve has too much hellraiser in him to leave it like that, he invoked the name of Willie Dixon, writer of some of the greatest modern blues songs, tunes like “Back Door Man,” “Hoochie Coochie Man,” “Spoonful,” “You Can’t Judge A Book By The Cover,” which were recorded by people like Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf and Bo Diddley. Asked why he wrote and played the blues, Dixon, three hundred pounds and crusty sharp, reputedly said, “money and women, what else is there?”\n\nThis was as good an answer as any, Steve remarked with a laugh. Because when it comes down to it – and to the great benefit of Steve Earle’s many admirers – it’s only so long that an honest man can avoid playing the blues.\n– Mark Jacobson, Brooklyn, NY\n\nThe Lounge at The Boulder Theater is now open Tuesday – Saturday and on event nights from 5:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. The Lounge at the Boulder Theater specializes in locally sourced small plates, fine wines, craft cocktails and microbrews.

We’ll also try to imagine a new commons, economies of shared resources to sponsor our ambitions and projects. This seeking of strategies and tactics will mark our considerations even as we meditate, or otherwise listen to wander, unplugging and drifting into the intelligence of refusing instrumentality. Knowing that poets start new cultural movements, that performance and community can provide leadings, we’ll ask some questions of each other: what moves, actions, and dreams need to be in our repertoire of resistance and creation for the Here & Now, what sorts of practices will see us though to the end of the world––the end of this world of immiseration––and unto another (new) world. Jackson Mac Low’s “Social Project 3” lays out one possible dream: “FIND A WAY TO PRODUCE EVERYTHING EVERYBODY NEEDS & GET IT TO THEM // MAKE IT WORK.” For the duration of our time together we’ll call ourselves a troupe, a cell, an assembly, a collective body, and ask what we might do with this chimera made of persons in performance. In her newest book, Notes Toward a Performative Theory of Assembly, Judith Butler writes of mass street protest, and the need for it to remain in our repertoire of struggle: “So when people amass on the street, one implication seems clear: they are still here, and still there; they persist; they assemble, and so manifest the understanding that their situation shared, or the beginning of such an understanding. And even when they are not speaking or do not present a set of negotiable demands, the call for justice is being enacted: the bodies assembled ‘say’ ‘we are not disposable,’ whether or not they are using words at the moment; what they say, as it were, is ‘we are still here, persisting, demanding greater justice, a release from precarity, a possibility of a livable life.”",

    "description": "King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard at Fox Theatre\n\nDoors - 8:30 PM\nShow - 9:00 PM\nAll Ages\nhttp://www.foxtheatre.com/event/1492452-king-gizzard-lizard-wizard-boulder/\n\n“As soon as the dust settles you can see an new world / In place of where the old one had been...” A concept album to end all concepts, Murder Of The Universe is the new collection by head-bending psychedelicists King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard Murder Of The Universe is a face-melting musical assault concerned with the downfall of man, the death of the planet....the murder of the whole goddamn universe. “We’re living in dystopian times that are pretty scary and it’s hard not to reflect that in our music,” says front man Stu Mackenzie. “It’s almost unavoidable. Some scientists predict that the downfall of humanity is just as likely to come at the hands of Artificial Intelligence, as it is war or viruses or climate change. But these are fascinating times too. Human beings are visual creatures – vision is our primary instinct, and this is very much a visual, descriptive, bleak record. While the tone is definitely Apocalyptic, it is not necessarily purely a mirror of the current state of humanity. It’s about new non-linear narratives.”\n\nLit by thunderclaps and lightning, Murder Of The Universe inhabits a sonic landscape of death, decay, ossification, fossilisation, rebirth. It is a place occupied by wandering shape-shifting beasts, bleeding skies, pools of blood, great fires and mushroom clouds; a planet rent asunder by conflict. It may take years for its true importance to be appreciated. There are simply no capital letters large enough to convey the EPIC nature of this collection. Their tenth album in five dizzying years, the first eight tracks of Murder Of The Universe alone sees songs doing battle with one another (‘Altered Beast’ Pts I to IV and ‘Alter Me’ Pts I to III), as man, beast and automaton collide in a death grapple. Flesh and bone meets mud and metal as the listener is treated to funereal fugue pieces (‘Some Context’), primordial drone-sludge (‘The Reticent Raconteur’), demonic doom-chants (‘The Floating Fire’), cyborg-narrated kosmiche workouts (‘Han-Tyumi, The Confused Cyborg’) and technicolour Outback proto-metal (‘Vomit Coffin’). A disorientating experience, the album hinges on three distinct chapters that rise from larval beds, and whose lyrics should be carved in stone, squeezed from moss, discovered in ancient runes. And all the while a passing cast of characters imbue the tale with both human and non-human emotions. Snippets of their breakthrough records I’m In Your Mind Fuzz and Nonagon Infinity resurface throughout in ghostly shadow form to haunt their latest sound. In years to come King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard will be judged not by their separate albums, but by a body of work where themes, melodies, motifs, riffs and ideas resurface and recur, each album peeling back a layer of the onion to glimpse at past and future alike.\n\nTheir albums should be treated as portals through which you can move from one to the other. Songs sync together, records can be played in loops and past ideas recur or are reprised, and then woven into new textures. “These ideas aren’t necessarily contrived,” says Stu “sometimes they just happen.”\n\nFormed in 2010 in Geelong, fifty miles outside of Melbourne (where they now reside) as a jam band off-shoot of a variety of other projects, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard released their debut album 12 Bar Bruise in 2012. Currently the most productive band on the planet, they are a once-in-generation group who play a heady combination of psychedelia, prog rock, freakbeat, jazz, heavy metal and Krautrock at a breathless punk pace; theirs is a high-velocity sound, each album atransportative diversion down a slippery worm-hole steered by seven minds sharing one on-going journey.\n\nThose who have seen them live will attest that King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard can go toe-to- toe with any of those forefathers that keen ears might hear shades of embedded deep within Murder Of The Universe: Aphrodite’s Child, Mahivishnu Orchestra, Hawkwind, King Crimson, The Doors, 13th Elevators, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Amon Duul II. Whether recording albums that connect into an infinite loop of sound (2016’s Nonagon Infinity), jazz-leaning pieces of the exact same length (2015’s Quarters!), surprising all-comers with a bucolic collection of sun-drenched pastoral folk-pop comedown music (2015’s Paper Mache Dream Balloon) King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard do not do things by halves. Their creative pudding is over-egged and all the better for it.\n\nMurder Of The Universe follows hot on the scorched black heels of Flying Microtonal Banana (March 2017), which saw the band customise their own instruments in order to explores those spaces between existing tones – microtones. Charting at No. 2 in Australia it is one of the most far-out collections to trouble the lower regions of the album charts in the US and UK too. Beyond Murder Of The Universe, the band will next release a jazz-based, improv- leaning collection entitled Sketches Of Brunswick East, whose name alludes to both Miles Davis’ Sketches Of Spain, the notion of sketches as outlines for ideas and all- round sketchy behaviour. Two more albums will follow that in 2017. But that is a story for another day.... King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard are: Stu Mackenzie (vocals/guitar/flute), Ambrose Kenny-Smith (harmonica/vocals), Cook Craig (guitar/vocals), Eric Moore (drums), Joey Walker (guitar), Lucas Skinner (bass) & Michael Cavanagh (drums).\n\nAlbum discography: 12 Bar Bruise (2012), Eyes Like the Sky (2013), Float Along – Fill Your Lungs (2013), Oddments (2014), I'm In Your Mind Fuzz (2014), Quarters!

Musical friendships that date back as far as 30 years. Todd Nance, Daniel Hutchens, Jerry Joseph, Sam Holt, John Neff and Jon Mills have shared stages and songs over the years and now form a new band that draws on those decades of collaboration. Todd Nance brings undeniable experience and depth to the band as a founding member/drummer/songwriter of Widespread Panic. Daniel Hutchens has been a driving force with the band Bloodkin for 29 years (and counting) and he is widely recognized as one of the South’s great modern day songwriters. Jerry Joseph and his various bands have been recording and touring on a national/international scale since the 80’s. Jerry’s expertise as a musician/songwriter is as unquestionable as his passion for sharing the power of music. He has recently toured and taught music in such far flung places as Afghanistan, Ghana and is soon to perform in Iraq. Sam Holt brings a reverence and intensity to playing the guitar that energizes the faithful fans of this community in a way that is second to none. John Neff (formerly of Drive-By Truckers) is the secret weapon that adds depth and soul via the pedal steel. And Mr. Jon Mills (professor emeritus of bass in the Athens, GA music scene) is the glue that keeps the whole thing tastefully held together.\n\nFans and industry veterans alike will find this band a compelling draw for its maiden voyage this summer season as evidenced by comments from Raleigh, NC based talent buyer Chris Malarkey (Lincoln Theatre): “When I was first approached about the possibility of bringing this lineup to town I thought 'man, this is too good to be true'. The thought of some of the most talented musicians to ever to walk through the doors of my venues joining forces not just for a show, but for a new band, seemed farfetched at best. But, somehow, someway the stars aligned, schedules were cleared and plans were made. The Interstellar Boys are real. What I can only describe as a dream band is booked.”\n\nThis accomplished group of musicians and songwriters look to explore new terrain touring together this summer….and have their eyes on the horizon to create some new material, get into the studio and keep pushing boundaries as they have always done.\n\nhttp://www.interstellarboys.com/",

Still one of the most powerful forces in Reggae, The Wailing Souls continue to tour globally and record new songs with the vigor that they had singing in Kingston's Trench Town decades ago.\n\nhttp://www.thewailingsouls.net/",

    "description": "DELBERT MCCLINTON\nwith Teresa James & The Rhythm Tramps\nBOULDER THEATER\nSeptember 13, 2017\nDoors:  7:00 pm | Show:  8:00 pm\nTickets on sale 10 a.m. Friday, April 21, 2017 at bouldertheater.com.\n$35.00 Reserved Floor | $40.00 Reserved Balcony | $45.00 Gold Circle plus applicable service charges\n \nMulti-Grammy Award winner Delbert McClinton is  “One of the Fortunate Few,” who has managed to live his dreams for more than six decades. The stars have aligned for Delbert. Those stars may have leaned toward the blues, but Delbert has managed to keep them on the bright side. \n\nI’ve Got Dreams To Remember: The Early Years \nHe was born four years after Buddy Holly in the musically fertile grounds of Lubbock, Texas. He cut his teeth on Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys at Lubbock’s legendary Cotton Club.  When he was 12, Delbert’s family moved to Fort Worth so his father could work on the Rock Island Railroad. \n\nAs a teenager, Delbert had a backstage and front row seat to learn from the masters as his teenage band grew into the house band at Fort Worth’s Jack's Place on the Jacksboro Highway, backing blues legends like Jimmy Reed, Howlin’ Wolf, Freddie King, Albert Collins, and Gatemouth Brown. \n\nStartin’ A Rumor: Delbert and Lennon  \nHis reputation grew, and when he was 22, he traveled with Bruce Channel to England to tour in support of Channel’s hit “Hey Baby,” on which he played harmonica.    Delbert and John Lennon spent time over a period of several days. The two 22-year old young musician/singers had a lot in common.   \n\nDelbert explains,  “The Beatles were opening for us on the tour.  They would open the show, then I would play three songs or so, and then Bruce (Channel) would come out and we would do the headliner set.  John wanted me to give him some tips on harmonica. The story’s been romanticized. I didn’t really teach him. I showed him what I did. When to suck and when to blow.  Nothing really more than that. Although it was a moment in time.”\n\nLivin’ It Down: Back to Texas\nDelbert returned to Texas and continued playing with legendary blues musicians, hitting the road when he could.  During the 1960s, he married and had a son, Monty, before the marriage crashed.   He continued playing in and around Fort Worth until he took up with a female friend who had just gotten divorced. She talked him into heading to Los Angeles.   \n\nTwo More Bottles of Wine: The Los Angeles Years\nSo McClinton moved to Los Angeles in the early 1970s to record with his songwriter partner, Glen Clark. The duo, under the name Delbert & Glen, released two albums with Atlantic Records.  The relationship with the divorcee didn’t last long, but the day she left, he sat on the mattress  in a dank rent house, and wrote a song about sweeping out a warehouse in West Los Angeles that became the first megahit for Emmylou Harris, “Two More Bottles of Wine.” And thus, began his series of “it’s all right” themes. \n\n\nAin’t Lost Nothin’: Texas and Tennessee\nMcClinton went home to Texas, met his second wife, and had his second son, Clay.  They moved to Nashville, and he signed with ABC Records. In 1975, he released his first solo project, Victim of Life’s Circumstances.  For the rest of the decade, McClinton released a string of successful albums and songs, including 1980’s Top 10 hit, “Givin’ It Up For Your Love.”\n\nChanges in tax laws and liberal tax advisors caused Delbert and his friend, Willie Nelson to wind up in the same tax shelter boat in the early 1980s, a time that has often been called Delbert’s “Lost Years.”\n\n“No. I wasn’t lost. I know where I was,” Delbert says, “ I was working for the IRS. They decided that I owed them several hundred thousand dollars. So I was playing for $700 a night and traveling with a loyal band, with the mattress I was born on under a camper shell in the back of the pickup   Sometimes the feds would show up at the gig and want all of our money. But we managed to get to the next gig.”\n\nPledging My Love: The Good Life\nAlong the way, he met his forever wife, Wendy Goldstein, a news producer for NBC, who agreed to a date after he played Saturday Night Live. A whirlwind romance followed. (She admits that the network held a position for her for 18 months, just in case she changed her mind.)  Nearly 30 years later, she is still on board.  And thanks to Wendy, Delbert got straight with the IRS, and has celebrated the greatest successes of his career, including his third child, a daughter, Delaney.   \n\nMcClinton earned his first Grammy nomination in 1989 for Live from Austin and his first win in 1991 for his duet with Bonnie Raitt on “Good Man, Good Woman.” The following year, McClinton collaborated on projects with Melissa Etheridge, Tom Petty, and Tanya Tucker, with whom he partnered on the popular, “Tell Me About It.”\n\nMcClinton earned two more Grammys and topped the Billboard Blues chart with a series of albums in the 2000s, including Nothing Personal, Cost of Living and Acquired Taste. He teamed up with Clark again for his most recent release, Blind, Crippled and Crazy.\n\nDelbert is driven by the lessons of his mentors, and shares what he has learned with those who follow the path. \n\nGiving It Up For Your Love: What’s Next\nDelbert McClinton has big plans up his sleeve. This is a big year for the multi-Grammy award winner and legendary musician.  In November, Delbert  turns 75. Live shows have been his focus and bread-and-butter throughout his career.  \n\nHe will be kicking off the yearlong Diamond Jubilee tour with more rocking energy than ever before. And it’s time.  Last year was a turning point. \n2014 was a rough year. In March, his son, Austin musician Clay McClinton, was in a car accident and suffered a head injury. Delbert and Wendy got the call in Nashville in the early morning hours from oldest son Monty, and flew to Austin to stay by Clay’s side in the hospital for several weeks. \n\nDelbert said, “That’s when I met me. That’s when I met who I was. And life has changed a great deal since then.”\n\n As Clay began to show signs of improvement, Delbert headed out to Florida for a show.   He recalls, “We got to the venue.  I thought I was having heartburn.  It got worse. I knew something was not right. They called EMS. They checked me out and told me that I was okay now, but should probably go to the hospital and find out if I had a heart attack.  I didn’t go with them, but had the promoter take me to the hospital, and  found out that yeah, I had a little “nudge,” they called it. They did a heart cath the next day and found that I had 95% blockage in the main artery. A Widow Maker, they call it.”   \n\nToday, Clay has almost completely recovered from his head injury and is also playing shows again. “He’s grateful,” Delbert says. “His wife, Brandy, said, ‘Clay has really taken advantage of his second chance.’”\n\nThe same can be said for Delbert. He has also made an incredible recovery.  Delbert returned to the stage two months after  his April, 2014 heart surgery.  “I didn’t know if I could sing. I didn’t know if I could be me,” he said, “but I found that I had so much more energy and more stamina. From 95% blockage to open road.  It made a big difference.” \n\nEverything Will Be Rosy: The Future\nAnd now Delbert has taken to that open road, full speed ahead.  He is playing in legendary, historic, and top venues from New York to California. He is planning his 22nd Annual Sandy Beaches Caribbean Cruise in January of 2016.  He’s working on a new album, and plans to have it ready to go in time for the Diamond Jubilee Celebration. He has one of the hottest bands he has ever toured with. And he is writing like never before. \n\nThe music for the new album is new and fresh, and maintains that Delbert McClinton signature. He easily describes what some struggle to define:  “Call it blues or country rock or American roots or whatever, but one of the most important things about my songs continues to be that there is always a way out.  Nothing I write spirals into the abyss. It’s all ‘I’ll be all right.’  The music is mostly so positive, in that ‘I’ll be okay’… ‘and maybe if’… ‘I’m hoping that’ frame of mind…. I always want to have an uplifting draft in the breeze of the song.”\n\n So what keeps the energy in more than 60 years of music?  His incredible musical versatility has been a blessing and a curse. He has managed to stay ahead of the curve – rather than just riding the wave  of musical popularity. He has paddled out and caught the wave as it is forming  as an innovator in American music. \n\nDelbert has found more than a million friends on the road, on the Sandy Beaches Cruises and on stages around the world.  His new album project includes a signature song that is easily his soundtrack for this year.\n \nThe Lounge at The Boulder Theater is now open Tuesday – Saturday and on event nights from 5:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. The Lounge at the Boulder Theater specializes in locally sourced small plates, fine wines, craft cocktails and microbrews.

    "description": "AMADOU & MARIAM\nBOULDER THEATER\nSaturday, July 29, 2017\nDoors:  7:00 pm | Show:  8:00 pm\nTickets on sale 10 a.m. TODAY, Friday, April 14, 2017 at bouldertheater.com. \n$25.00 ADV | $27.00 DOS plus applicable service charges\n\nFive years after Folila, their last energetic rock album where the cream of the future of pop music collaborated, the Malian duo Amadou & Mariam are back with one of their trademark sensual and highly danceable gems. The godparents of the Afrobeat and modern pop mélange, and the mix between traditional and electronic music, have a new album, La Confusion, produced by Adrien Durand. He’s the orchestrator of the project Bon Voyage Organisation, mixing African and Asian influences, disco and electro and giving a new sheen to the concept of world music. \n\n“Boufou Safou”, the first single, with its bouncy lyrics in Bambara and French, is a small gem of slow-paced Afro-disco, carried by Mariam’s magical voice, gently poking fun at the nonchalance of African boys. This places the duo in the same electro-dance territory explored a few years back with producer Damon Albarn on Welcome to Mali’s “Sabali”. It is a tribute to personalities such as Francis Bebey or William Oneyeabor who, very early on, started mixing traditional music and experimentations. With remixes by Africaine 808, Fatima Yamaha, Henrik Schwarz and Pakem, Amadou & Mariam are back on the dance floor.\n\nFor the past forty-odd years, Amadou & Mariam have managed to joyfully combine their love story with a musical career while becoming, discreetly but surely, the most famous ambassadors for Malian music, and African music, all around the world; a golden status that they carry with brio and playfully challenge with each new album. Amadou & Mariam have collaborated with many different people and worked with producers that seem far removed from their universe, like Damon Albarn of Blur or Manu Chao. They have invited the best artists who are building tomorrow’s pop music to play on their naïve and lively songs (Santigold, TV On The Radio, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs) and have had their tracks remixed by Yuksek, Vitalic, Henrik Schwarz, Miike Snow and Ashley Beedle, leading the songs to the dance floor and underlining their intrinsically danceable quality. They’ve played the world’s biggest festivals, from Coachella to Glastonbury, and opened for huge bands such as Coldplay and the Scissor Sisters. Amadou talks about their status: “It’s always been our wish that African music be known like other kinds of music. That’s why we’re very proud of our album Dimanche à Bamako (their first international success), because it popularized our country’s music. Our collaborations changed the way people see us. We’re African, but our hybrid music opened a lot of doors for us.”\n\nFlashback. Amadou Bagayoko met Mariam Doumbia at the Malian Institute for the Young Blind in Bamako in 1975, where they both played in the Eclipse Orchestra. They fell in love instantly and began a singular story of music and love. Mariam had been singing at family gatherings since she was six years old and Amadou, at barely 20, was a guitar prodigy. With his unique technique, finding inspiration in the roots of African music and in American blues, he played in one of the most respected Malian music bands of the 1970s: Les Ambassadeurs du Motel de Bamako. Amadou and Mariam married, became a duo in the early 80s and started their long climb to success and international recognition. For logistical reasons, they settled in the large city of Abidjan in Côte d’Ivoire and started releasing their first tracks on cassette tapes, as was the custom in Africa at the time. They performed all around Africa and eventually released their first albums, Tje Ni Mousso and Wati, produced by French labels, offering them a new platform.\n\nBut the ‘90s weren’t very open to genre-bending, and Malian music only appealed to a small demographic. At the time, even though they were big stars in Africa, Amadou & Mariam seemed destined for anonymity as soon as they left the African continent. Things changed in 1998 with their first performance at the Transmusicales de Rennes festival, following the popular radio success of their singles ‘Mon Amour Ma Chérie’ and ‘Je Pense À Toi’ (from Sou Ni Tilé), with their pop accents, and their career finally took an international turn. But they truly broke out with the huge success of their album Dimanche à Bamako (500 000 albums worldwide, 300 000 of which were sold in France), produced by Manu Chao. On this record, Amadou & Mariam seem to have really found their DNA. A magical recipe based on different collaborations with a wide array of artists, which they applied from then on. They chose Damon Albarn of Blur for their electro-pop Welcome to Mali (containing ‘Sabali’, an irresistible Afro-disco hit song). On the more up-tempo Folila, Amadou reunited with his love of rock (he’s a fan of Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, AC/DC and Bad Company) and invited choice artists such as Theophilus London, TV On The Radio, Ebony Bones and Santigold, to bring their contributions to their music and, each in their own way, speak of a period of the couple’s life.\n\nMixing traditional African rhythms with Western pop, using traditional instruments as well as beat boxes and synthesizers, playing rock, reggae, funk, soul and blues, mixing acoustic and digital productions, lyrics in French, English and Malian, Amadou & Mariam articulate the past and the future beautifully through their production, composition and collaborations that unite opposites and allow them to represent Mali across the world. But mostly, by enriching their Afro-pop with new pigments, by introducing to the world the richness and subtleties of African music, the duo has brought African music to the charts and to the dance floor. \n\nThey’ve inspired many artists to mix Afro and electro sounds, such as MHD, DJ Mujava, Awesome Tapes From Africa, Four Tet or Jamie xx. This is proof that, if in the 80s certain crazy minds had fantasies of a Sono Mondiale, Amadou& Mariam are the ones who have made it a reality.\n \nThe Lounge at The Boulder Theater is now open Tuesday – Saturday and on event nights from 5:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. The Lounge at the Boulder Theater specializes in locally sourced small plates, fine wines, craft cocktails and microbrews.

    "description": "Jay Som at Fox Theatre\n\nDoors - 8:30 PM\nShow - 9:00 PM\nAll Ages\nhttp://www.foxtheatre.com/event/1478506-jay-som-boulder/\n\nOn her first proper album as Jay Som, Melina Duterte, 22, solidifies her rep as a self-made force of sonic splendor and emotional might. If last year's aptly named Turn Into compilation showcased a fuzz-loving artist in flux—chronicling her mission to master bedroom recording—then the rising Oakland star's latest, Everybody Works, is the LP equivalent of mission accomplished. \n\nDuterte is as DIY as ever—writing, recording, playing, and producing every sound beyond a few backing vocals—but she takes us places we never could have imagined, wedding lo-fi rock to hi-fi home orchestration, and weaving evocative autobiographical poetry into energetic punk, electrified folk, and dreamy alt-funk. \n\nAnd while Duterte's early stuff found her bucking against life's lows, Everybody Works is about turning that angst into fuel for forging ahead. \"Last time I was angry at the world,\" she says. \"This is a note to myself: everybody's trying their best on their own set of problems and goals. We're all working for something.\"\n\nEverybody Works was made in three furious, caffeinated weeks in October. She came home from the road, moved into a new apartment, set up her bedroom studio (with room for a bed this time) and dove in. Duterte even ditched most of her demos, writing half the LP on the spot and making lushly composed pieces like \"Lipstick Stains\" all the more impressive. While the guitar-grinding Jay Som we first fell in love with still reigns on shoegazey shredders like \"1 Billion Dogs\" and in the melodic distortions of \"Take It,\" we also get the sublimely spacious synth-pop beauty of \"Remain,\" and the luxe, proggy funk of \"One More Time, Please.\" \n\nDuterte's production approach was inspired by the complexity of Tame Impala, the simplicity of Yo La Tengo, and the messiness of Pixies. \"Also, I was listening to a lot of Carly Rae Jepsen to be quite honest,\" she says. \"Her E•MO•TION album actually inspired a lot of the sounds on Everybody Works.\" \n\nThere's story in the sounds—even in the fact that Duterte's voice is more present than before. As for the lyrics, our host leaves the meaning to us. So if we can interpret, there's a bit about the aspirational and fleeting nature of love in the opener, and the oddity of turning your art into job on the titular track. There's even one tune, \"The Bus Song,\" that seems to be written as a dialog between two kids, although it plays like vintage Broken Social Scene and likely has more to do with yearning for things out of reach. \n\nWhile there's no obvious politics here, Duterte says witnessing the challenges facing women, people of color, and the queer community lit a fire. And when you reach the end of Everybody Works, \"For Light,\" you'll find a mantra suitable for anyone trying, as Duterte says, \"to find your peace even it it's not perfect.\" As her trusty trumpet blows, she sings: \"I'll be right on time, open blinds for light, won't forget to climb.\"\n\nhttp://www.jaysommusic.com/",

The interweaving lead vocals of Ghana Queen (LaSha Afarko) and the Reverend EverReady (Will Baumgartner) are laid over a hard-grooving rhythm section and ornamented by the notorious Soul Shouters Horns (Baumgartner, Maus Nomdeguerre, Paul Stadler, and Alice Hansen). With lyrics reminiscent of the intelligence, humor and social consciousness of their legendary influences and a relentlessly upbeat drive to their musical arrangements, the group lifts listeners’ spirits into a rarefied atmosphere. Based in Boulder Colorado, TPS have been driving fans onto the dance floor and happily out of their minds for a half-decade, and show no intention of slowing down. In late 2016, the band released their EP “Jive Church”, which has been getting airplay on local stations such as KGNU and The Colorado Sound. Also in the past year, TPS has shared shows with such great local and national/international acts as Euforquestra, Analog Son, Orgone, and Seun Kuti & Egypt 80; won the 2016 Bolder Boulder Battle of the Bands; and performed live on the radio at KGNU, KBCO and Radio 1190. As stated in Marquee Magazine, “TPS bring the funk wherever they perform. Experiencing their unavoidable dance scene firsthand is a must.” And as the Reverend EverReady says in their audience-interactive “Jive Church” theatrical experience, “The Funk will Set You Free!”\n\nhttp://www.thepamlicosound.com/\n\nOriginating in Denver, Colorado, THE JIVE TRIBE is a band that embodies the spirit, vibe, and attitude of Colorado's colorful culture. By taking inspiration from a wide variety of different artists and genres, The Jive Tribe has managed to craft a sound and style that is unique and very difficult to describe. Different musical backgrounds, training and performance styles have given the band a unique musical diversity and the ability to combine genres such as Jazz, Funk, Rock, R&B, Soul, Blues, Hip-Hop, and Psychedelia. This melting pot of different creative ideas and perspectives has led to a new sound and genre of its own which the band has come to call Jive. The band is excited to announce the debut release of their new, unique and mindbending sound on their penultimate album, Jive. Available NOW on iTunes, Spotify, Google Play , CD baby, and all other major digital distribution softwares, and trust us this album is surely not something to miss, so get your copy now!

Things that, rightfully, send cold sweat nightmares.  For kids it can be anything from the darkness under a bed, or strangers, or crossing a busy street.  For adults it might change face a bit and become things like sickness, job security, or heartbreak.  And sometimes, when you point the flashlight right at the thing you’re terrified of, you declaw it.  You take its mask off and it returns to being an empty, boring closet with nothing inside to harm you.  Or maybe the light shows an unexpected beauty in the place of what you thought was horrific. Other times, though, you aim the beam straight into the pitch black and the thing that you prayed wasn’t real, the one with all the teeth, is right there smiling at you. \n\nTexas born duo Penny and Sparrow know these things, and in their 2017 release Wendigo they turn the lights off on purpose and hunt for what’s really there in the dark.  With a musical maturity that has been honed over half a decade and hundreds of live shows, Kyle Jahnke and Andy Baxter are presenting their most ambitious album yet.  Rejoined by Chris Jacobie (producer and engineer of Creature, Tenboom, Struggle Pretty & Christmas Songs) Penny & Sparrow delve into numerous new and diverse sound landscapes throughout Wendigo, without sacrificing the sharp honesty that’s accompanied their career thus far.   \n\nFrom the quarter kick laden DzSalome and Saint Proculadz, to the pitched-down vibe of DzKindz and all the way to the hypnotically instrumental portion of DzThere’s a lot of us in heredz, it’s obvious that Wendigo is unafraid to be sonically experimental.  Thematically, Baxter’s word bank reaches further than on previous albums.  From the trilogy of songs humanizing the Grim Reaper (DzVisitingdzDzSmittendzDzMonikerdz) and cascading down to the Urban Legend love song DzWendigodz, the intersection of daily grit and supernatural fable is analyzed in depth.  On the back half of the record, Jahnke’s melodic leadership extends even deeper into beauty and surprise.  With seamless track fusion from  DzA kind of HungerdztoDzLet me be Crucialdz, Jahnke has invented a 6 song musical terrain that is both complex in its varied offerings and impressive in its execution.   \n\nArriving a year and a half after Let a Lover Drown You, their Muscle Shoals recorded, John Paul White produced last album, Wendigo was born from healing and heat.  Having moved to Florence to record in the Single Lock studio, Baxter and Jahnke found themselves with time off in their first boiling Alabama summer. Exhausted from touring and life-weary in general, the duo turned to songwriting for catharsis.  A makeshift recording rig was set up in the living room of their shared home and the duo began workshopping song after song.  Over the course of that summer, while their wives (and a dog named Gator) bustled around the microphone during sessions, the bones of the record were set.  The original plan was to listen to the rough tracks and eventually redo everything cleaner.  That desire changed though as they fell in love with the honest sounds of cooking, old door hinges, silverware clinking, and the rest of their Alabama home noise.  As affection for the demo’s grew, Baxter and Jahnke realized that they wanted to keep as much of them as possible. Thus, listening to Wendigo is hearing the honest soundtrack for a real season in the life of two families.  The footsteps, the creaking and the din of supper prep heard throughout the songs all reinforce the sense of integrity that has long been a staple of the band.  Releasing on August 25, 2017, Wendigo will be Penny and Sparrow’s 5thfull-length album.  Beginning as therapeutic demos in northern Alabama and ending as a fully realized project at Jacobie’s home studio in San Antonio,TX, this record leaves the duo smirking and feeling accomplished.   \n\nThe creature with which this album shares its name is a shape shifter.  One moment it looks completely normal and the next it’s all fangs and gore.  In an instant it can slip it’s skin and go back and forth from ominous and ugly to hope and lovely.  Life can be like that. Hell, we can be like that.  Knowing this, Penny and Sparrow offer Wendigo as the flashlight you can arm yourself with.  Use it to see what’s worth fearing and what was actually beautiful all along.  Shine it into whatever patch of darkness scares you.  For better or worse, at least you’ll know what’s there.\n \nThe Lounge at the Boulder Theater is now open Tuesday – Saturday and on event nights from 5:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. The Lounge at the Boulder Theater specializes in locally sourced small plates, fine wines, craft cocktails and microbrews.

But in a twist, he did it in Portuguese, accompanying himself simply on acoustic guitar. Seu Jorge’s adaptations in Portuguese of David Bowie’s music underscore the breadth and depth of his compositions and have gone on to have a significant cultural impact.\n\n“Had Seu Jorge not recorded my songs in Portuguese, I would never have heard this new level of beauty which he has imbued them with.” — David Bowie",

    "description": "105.5 The Colorado Sound Present\nSARAH JAROSZ + JAMES MCMURTRY\nBOULDER THEATER\nFriday, July 21, 2017\nDoors:  7:00 pm | Show:  8:00 pm\nTickets on sale 10 a.m. Friday, April 14, 2017 at bouldertheater.com. \n$25.00 GA | $30.00 RES plus applicable service charges\n\nAbout Sarah Jarosz: With her fourth album, Undercurrent, Sarah Jarosz makes a studied departure from her previous records, shifting the emphasis from her skills as a multi-instrumentalist to her songwriting and vocal performance. Undercurrent accentuates the growth and maturity that Jarosz, now 25, has achieved since graduating from New England Conservatory and moving to New York City. The change in approach garnered Jarosz two Grammy Awards in 2017-for Best Folk Album Year for Undercurrent and for Best American Roots Performance for \"House Of Mercy\". She also picked up the award for 2017 Folk Album of the Year from Folk Alliance International for Undercurrent.\n\nOn Undercurrent, Jarosz delivers a set of all-original songs, centered around four solo pieces that set the tone of the record. Uncut Magazine describes it as \"an enthralling journey from source to mouth,\" and goes on to say \"These are songs about the choices we make, the paths we take and the things we leave behind, a deep meditation on the invisible currents that guide us.\" The Wall Street Journal notes \"This economical approach brings the listener closer to Ms. Jarosz than on any of her previous recordings, and it suits the lyrical theme of passion that, mostly, is forbidden and unrequited.\"\n\nThe Austin Chronicle's Jim Caligiuri declared \"For Austinites who've followed her since her early teens, the fact that Wimberley native Sarah Jarosz blossomed into one of the most stirring musicians of her generation comes as absolutely no surprise,\" while Consequence of Sound''s Michelle Geslani noted the \"startling sense of insight\" in Jarosz's compositions. NPR's Katie Presley made note of Jarosz's newfound maturity, praising her \"uncharacteristically (and deliciously) unyielding\" vocal carriage.\n\nAbout James McMurtry: James McMurtry spins stories with a poet’s pen (“Long Island Sound”) and a painter’s precision (“She Loves Me”). Proof: The acclaimed songwriter’s newComplicated Game. McMurtry’s first collection in six years spotlights a craftsman in absolutely peak form as he turns from political toward personal (“These Things I’ve Come to Know,” “You Got to Me”). “The lyrical theme is mostly about relationships,” McMurtry says. “It’s also a little about the big old world verses the poor little farmer or fisherman. I never make a conscious decision about what to write about.”\n\nComplicated Game delivers McMurtry’s trademark story songs time and again (“Copper Canteen,” “Deaver’s Crossing”), but the record brings a new (and certainly no less energetic) sonic approach. First, recall blistering beats and gnashing guitars from his magnum opus Just Us Kids (2008). Now, unplug. “The label head wanted more acoustic,” McMurtry explains. “We built everything as we went so we ended up with more acoustic guitar as we went. We just played whatever sounded right for a given song, but we weren’t necessarily saying this is an acoustic record.”\nExhibit A: “How’m I Gonna Find You Now.” The record’s lead single boasts buoyant banjos and driving drums as endlessly energetic as anything electrified. Whiplash vocals further frenzy the beat. “I've got a cup of black coffee so I don't get lazy/I've got a rattle in the dashboard driving me crazy,” McMurtry effectively raps. “If I hit it with my fist, it’ll quit for a little while/Gonna have to stop to smoke in another mile/Headed into town gonna meet you at the mercantile/Take you to the Sonic get you grinning like a crocodile.”\n\nSuch vibrant vignettes consistently turn heads. They have for a quarter century now. Clearly, he’s only improving with time. “James McMurtry is one of my very few favorite songwriters on Earth and these days he's working at the top of his game,” says Americana all-star Jason Isbell. “He has that rare gift of being able to make a listener laugh out loud at one line and choke up at the next. I don’t think anybody writes better lyrics.” “James writes like he's lived a lifetime,” echoes iconic roots rocker John Mellencamp. Yes. Spin “South Dakota.” You’ll hear.\n\nFurther evidence: McMurtry’s Just Us Kids (2008) and Childish Things (2005). The former earned his highest Billboard 200 chart position in nearly two decades and notched Americana Music Award nominations. Meanwhile, Childish Things scored endless critical praise and spent six full weeks topping the Americana Music Radio chart in 2005 and 2006. In 2006, Childish Things won the Americana Music Association’s Album of the Year and “We Can’t Make It Here” was named the rapidly rising organization's Song of the Year.\n\nOf course, Complicated Game doubles down on literate storytelling longtime enthusiasts expect. Recall high watermarks past: “Childish Things,” “Choctaw Bingo,” “Peter Pan,” “Levelland,” and “Out Here in the Middle” only begin the list. (Yes, Robert Earl Keen covered those last two, “Levelland” remaining a live staple.) Just Us Kidsalone includes fan favorites “Hurricane Party,” “Ruby and Carlos” and “You’d a Thought.” High watermarks deliver equal measures depth and breadth and pierce hearts with sharp sociopolitical commentary (“Fireline Road”).\n\nMore history: McMurtry critically lauded first album Too Long in the Wasteland (1989) was produced by John Mellencamp and marked the beginning of a series of acclaimed projects for Columbia and Sugar Hill Records. In 1996, McMurtry received a Grammy nomination for Long Form Music Video for Where'd You Hide the Body. Additionally, It Had to Happen (1997) received the American Indie Award for Best Americana Album.\n\nIn 2004, McMurtry released the universally lauded Live in Aught-Three on Compadre Records. The following year, Childish Things notched arguably his most critical praise, spending six weeks at No. 1 on the Americana Music Radio Chart in 2005 and 2006. In September 2006, Childish Things and “We Can’t Make It Here” won the Americana Music Awards for Album and Song of the Year, respectively. McMurtry received more Americana Music Award nominations for 2008’s Just Us Kids. This album marked his highest Billboard 200 chart position in more than nearly two decades.\n\nIn 2009, Live in Europe was released, capturing the McMurtry band’s first European tour and extraordinary live set. Along with seasoned band members Ronnie Johnson, Daren Hess, and Tim Holt, the disc features special guests Ian McLagan (The Faces) and Jon Dee Graham (True Believers, Skunks). Also, for the first time ever, video of the James McMurtry Band’s live performance is available on the included DVD.\n\nThe poignant lyrics of his immense catalog still ring true today. In 2011, “We Can’t Make It Here” was cited among The Nation’s “Best Protest Songs Ever.” “‘We Can’t Make It Here,’” Bob Lefsetz wrote, “has stood the test of time because of its unmitigated truth.”\n\nMcMurtry tours year round and consistently throws down unparalleled powerhouse performances. The Washington Post notes: “Much attention is paid to James McMurtry’s lyrics and rightfully so: He creates a novel’s worth of emotion and experience in four minutes of blisteringly stark couplets. What gets overlooked, however, is that he’s an accomplished rock guitar player ... serious stuff, imparted by a singularly serious band.”\n\n\nThe Lounge at The Boulder Theater is now open Tuesday – Saturday and on event nights from 5:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. The Lounge at the Boulder Theater specializes in locally sourced small plates, fine wines, craft cocktails and microbrews.

Yet writing is often spurred on the by the urgency to “get it all down” before it slides from the memory or the imagination. Shelley’s image of the fading coal ember as the figure for the inspired mind racing to translate its being into the poem graphs this drama precisely. Impermanence, of course, is a key to Buddhist thought––hard wisdom that everything is always already passing away, and perhaps most truly has no claim beyond the moment. Yet beyond “the happening,” how can art, how can writing integrate the fact of impermanence into its grammar, and means of being? We’ll ask this collectively, and put those (provisional) answers to the test individually in our own lines and sentences. We’ll focus on documentary/investigatory poetics as activist practices, the memoir (and anti-memoir) as openings into narratives and records of erased histories, and how writing might bear the trace of the endangered worlds: eco-poetics being new musics for the new weathers. We’ll also call to mind the counter-story: how the various techniques of documenting, recording, and reckoning are increasingly involved it the state’s modes of surveillance and control. In taking account of this transient world, and our fleeting places in it, and our even more evanescent thoughts of it, we find ourselves––if finding even begins to get it right––between reckoning and letting go; and what can be made of this dialectic, we propose to find out.",

    "description": "DUE TO POPULAR DEMAND the Bad Suns performance on June 14th at the Fox Theatre has been moved to the Boulder Theater on the same date! Hang on to your tickets - all Fox Theatre tickets will be honored. Tickets for the Boulder Theater are on sale now!\n\nKTCL Channel 933 Presents\nBad Suns with HUNNY\n\nDoors - 8:30 PM\nShow - 9:00 PM\n$15 ADV | $18 DOS\nAll Ages\n\nWith the release of Disappear Here, Bad Suns' impressively wise and honest sophomore album, it is hard to believe the four-piece began as a chance friendship between Christo Bowman (vocals) and Gavin Bennett (bass) in a 7th grade Los Angeles County classroom. The pair picked up Miles Morris (drums) and Ray Libby (guitar) along the way, and together they spent their teenage years navigating the daunting Los Angeles music scene.\n\nWhile many would consider the vast history and densely populated musical turf of Los Angeles intimidating, Bad Suns rose to the challenge. As Bowman recalls, \"I can recount many instances where we'd play the Whisky a Go Go along with five terrible glam-rock-wanna-be bands. It made us want to do something different and work towards a new era of the Los Angeles sound.\" While finding their place in LA's scene wasn't easy, Bowman is also thankful for the innumerable opportunities that come with living in one of the nation's musical capitals. \"Our band was discovered because we drove to KROQ and dropped off a demo in their mailbox,\" he says, \"At the end of the day, nobody's going to care about your band unless you've got some good songs for them.\"\n\nThe song that caught the ear of KROQ DJ Kat Corbett was \"Cardiac Arrest,\" the band's first and breakthrough single, on her Locals Only radio show. From there, the band earned the attention of Vagrant Records, who signed Bad Suns in 2013 and introduced the band to producer Eric Palmquist (Night Riots, MUTEMATH). Together, Palmquist and Bad Suns polished up the demos to create TRANSPOSE, their debut 4-song EP which was released later that year. On the strength of the EP Bad Suns began to tour throughout the US alongside acts like Geographer, The 1975, and The Vaccines.\n\nLess than a year later, Bad Suns returned with their debut full-length, Language & Perspective (2014/Vagrant). The shimmery alt-rock album, also produced by Palmquist, showed off the young band's wide array of influences, which Bowman often says include The Cure, The Clash and Elvis Costello. \"Cardiac Arrest\" began to pick up steam at radio nationally and climbed the Alternative chart (#14) and AAA (#11), and earning the band their debut Late Night television performance on Conan. With the success of \"Cardiac Arrest\" and a heavy touring schedule, Language & Perspective rose to #24 on the Billboard 200 and was included on many critics' best of 2014 year-end lists. \"Salt,\" the band's second single, followed suit and quickly climbed the Alternative chart and earned Bad Suns their first mtvU Woodie nomination for Video of the Year, a performance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and their debut at Coachella.\n\nJust a few years into their budding career, Bad Suns had achieved no small amount of success with their debut record, something which can often be daunting for a young band staring down the barrel of a sophomore album. Instead of shying away or playing it safe, Bowman began to refine a set of songs which would become Disappear Here, Bad Suns' 2016 sophomore album (Vagrant/BMG). Disappear Here shows the maturation of a band on the brink of fully realizing their identity and poised for a breakthrough. \"Language and Perspective was four teenagers trying to figure out how to make an album as a way to avoid college and real jobs,\" Bowman explains, \"With this album, it was our real job, and we were not gonna half-ass it. We love the work.\"\n\nBowman was reading the Bret Easton Ellis novel Less Than Zero, a book about the distorted lives of young adults in Los Angeles, during the time the band was beginning the recording process for album number two. \"Maybe the second or third time the 'Disappear Here' billboard appears in the narrative, it sort of just hit me like a ton of bricks. It encapsulated absolutely everything. What a prompt, 'put on this record, put on these headphones, and just disappear here for a little while,'\" Bowman explains.\n\n\"It's a roller coaster ride between pessimism and optimism,\" he says. \"I wanted these real moments of darkness to be represented and discussed, because we all go through it, but it's really about hope and saying that you don't have to succumb to that darkness. There is a light.\"\n\nRecorded over two sessions in the Summer of 2015 and Winter of 2016, the album begins with the title track and first single \"Disappear Here,\" a cut that immediately engages listeners. The first song released in anticipation of the album was the opener, title track, and first single, \"Disappear Here,\" followed by the album's second song, \"Heartbreaker,\" which debuted on Zane Lowe's Beats1 Radio Show. \"Off She Goes\" holds a strong emotional connection for Bowman. The track came to life as just melodies and chords on the piano before he wrote the lyrics and he remembers, \"just being moved to tears the whole way through.\"\n\nConversely, \"Love Like Revenge\" started off as an electronic laptop demo recorded on a plane back to LA from London. Bowman was excited to share the track with his bandmates, \"I gave Ray my headphones, looking for his opinion, and I still remember his face of approval as he listened to it in the seat next to me on the plane. That's the best. We're always aiming to impress one another.\" The unique instrumentation makes it a standout on the record.\n\n\"Defeated,\" a track that Bowman penned when he was only 16 years old, had been cyclically recorded and abandoned over the years. \"It was a huge relief to finally get that song where we wanted it,\" he says, \"It's one of the simplest songs on the album, but was the most difficult to work through.\" \"Daft Pretty Boys\" is a song the band is particularly proud of, one that they might point new listeners to as an introduction to their sound. Disappear Here closes with \"Outskirts of Paradise,\" a track that feels like a breezy, late summer day in Los Angeles. With the simple refrain of \"separate yourself / integrate yourself / when the time comes,\" Disappear Here fades out, with all the certainty and uncertainty of a coming of age tale.\n\nCrafted for the live show, Bad Suns can't wait to take the album on the road. After serving as main support on massive tours for The Neighbourhood and Halsey in the past year, Bad Suns embark on their biggest headlining tour yet this fall. \"Our fans are so warm and loyal. A lot of them will go through some shit in order to make it out to one of our concerts. I'm talking flights, busses, 12-hour car drives, you name it. That will always be very special to me,\" Bowman says, \"We're really grateful to be in this position where we can sell out clubs across the country, and we still feel we have so much to prove.\"\n\nhttp://badsuns.tumblr.com/",

Phil began playing under the moniker Phil Lesh and Friends in 1998, after he'd returned to performing following the death of his friend and bandmate Jerry Garcia in 1995. With a varied mixture of some of the best performing musicians in the live music universe, Phil has kept his musical journey fresh by constantly and consistently putting together bands featuring dynamic, exciting musicians and singers working together toward keeping the music of the Grateful Dead moving forward into the future.\n\nFormed from weekly shows at Phil's Terrapin Crossroads in San Rafael, CA, the Terrapin Family Band has become the venue's official house band. Terrapin Crossroads' constant free bar shows, often featuring bandleader Phil, have created an opportunity for the young musicians of Terrapin Crossroads to perform together and with a diverse cast of visiting musicians. Through playing in this setting, and with ongoing mentoring from Phil, the Terrapin Family Band has grown into a richly nuanced and fun band, weaving the classics with obscure covers and fresh original music to create a unique musical tapestry.\n\nTickets are on sale at Boulder Theater Box Office, by phone at (303)-786-7030 or online at www.foxtheatre.com",

Self-described as “psychedelic rock fusion”, Cycles effortlessly blends rock, jazz, hip-hop, soul, and much more creating a versatile soundscape that makes each live show different than the last.\nStriving for variety in each set, Cycles carefully construct a live show designed to thrill. Each member brings a special set of skills and influences to the table. Living in the same house together and practicing hours upon hours each day has created a profound chemistry between the band members that truly shines through in the live setting. Tucker McClung is a powerful commander of the bass who never shies away from applying the melodic nature of the instrument all the while leading the show with compelling vocals. Michael Wood, with his tight and jazzy drum beats, works tirelessly to keep the band on track through intricate tempo changes and wide-open space. Patrick Harvey’s dominating guitar shred is what completes the band’s sound and often drives them to take the jams into outer space. \n\nAUDIO - Self-Titled EP, “Cycles”\nhttp://bit.ly/CyclesEPSC \nFirst EP, “Loads Of Fun”\nhttp://bit.ly/LoadsOfFun1Z1bjDD \n“Get Out Of Your Head” ft.

    "description": "97.3 KBCO Presents\nReal Estate with Lucy Dacus at Fox Theatre\n\nDoors - 8:30 PM\nShow - 9:00 PM\nAll Ages\nhttp://www.foxtheatre.com/event/1486064-real-estate-boulder/\n\nIn Mind, the fourth full-length record from Real Estate, is a portrait of a mature band at the height of its power. Long respected for their deft lyrical hand and gorgeous melodies, In Mind builds upon the band’s reputation for crafting perfect songs and carries Real Estate even deeper into the pantheon of great songwriters.\n\nOn the new record, the band fine-tunes the winsome songwriting and profound earnestness that made previous albums—2009’s Real Estate, 2011’s Days, and 2014’s Atlas—so beloved, and pushes their songs in a variety of compelling new directions. Written primarily by guitarist and vocalist Martin Courtney at his home in Beacon—a quiet town in upstate New York—In Mind offers a shifting of the gears, positing a band engaged in the push/pull of burgeoning adulthood. Reflecting a change in lineup, changes in geography, and a general desire to move forward without looking back, the record casts the band in a new light—one that replaces the wistful ennui of teenage suburbia with an equally complicated adult version. The record not only showcases some of the band’s most sublime arrangements to date, it also presents a leap forward in terms of production, with the band utilizing the studio as a tool to broaden the sonic landscape of their music to stunning effect.\n\nIn Mind offers passing nods to the sanguine qualities of earlier releases while also depicting a band in a state of real change. Since the recording of the band’s last album, Courtney had become a father of two and settled into a newfound domesticity living in Beacon, while bassist Alex Bleeker made the move out to sunny California, creating a complicated new set of logistics for the band to work around. \n\nAdditionally, after the departure of founding member and lead guitarist Matt Mondanile in 2015, the band—Courtney, Bleeker, and drummer Jackson Pollis—faced the prospect of either closing ranks or embracing the changes that bringing in new people would ultimately bring. “It just seemed like a good moment to move in a slightly different direction,” says Courtney, “The idea of bringing in a stranger seemed too weird, but I wasn’t interested in recording as a four-piece and having some hired gun come out to play shows with us. In the end asking Julian Lynch—who we’d already been playing with and we’ve known since high school—to join the band made the most sense. He felt like a full-time member of the band already.” This was also true of keyboardist Matt Kallman, who previously played with the band on Atlas and on that record’s subsequent tour. Joining the band in a more official capacity before the recording of In Mind, Kallman contributed in both sound and scope, writing the keyboard parts and contributing to the album’s arrangements. With a new lineup secured and armed with an arsenal of songs that Courtney and Bleeker had spent the past six months writing, the band approached the business of fleshing out the songs in an almost workmanlike manner.\n\n“It was good being outside of the city,” recalls Kallman. “We got a little Airbnb in Beacon and we rented a practice space inside an old converted high school. We would walk to the high school and play music all day, then go play basketball, go to the health food store or go out to dinner, then go back to the house. We did that every day for, in total, about three weeks. It was nice not having the headache of our regular lives. It all felt very open, like we were planted there to do a job and that’s all we could do was just work on the songs. I think the music kind of reflects that space we were in—free and open and cautiously optimistic.”\n\nRecorded in Los Angeles with producer Cole M.G.N. (known for his work with the likes of Beck, Snoop Dogg, Dam-Funk, Nx Worries, and Julia Holter), the eleven tracks on In Mind deliver the same kind of warmth and soft-focus narratives that one has come to expect from the band—pastoral guitars, elegantly deployed arrangements, a sort of mindful melancholy—but there is also a newly adventurous sonic edge to the proceedings. Album opener—the ebullient pop number “Darling” — announces itself with a wash of synth tones rather than guitars. Elsewhere, on tracks like “Serve the Song” and “Two Arrows,” guitarist Julian Lynch employs a variety of distorted guitar sounds that might have felt out of place on previous Real Estate records, with the latter track stretching out beyond the six-minute mark—the closest thing to a jam the band has ever recorded. The band’s predilection for crafting airtight pop songs remains in full-effect here, with songs like “Stained Glass” and “Same Sun” occupying the same kind of rarefied universe as fan favorites like “Talking Backwards” or “It’s Real.” ‘Where does one thing ever end and the next begin?’ Courtney asks in the latter, ‘I do not wish to retrace the steps I’ve taken / All that matters now is where I’m going.’\n\nGlittering pop moments aside, the record’s most stunning moments are arguably it’s most restrained— “After the Moon” unspools in waltz-like fashion, while album closer “Saturday” offers In Mind’s most pointed take on moving beyond the fascinations of youth: ‘When a stranger is living in your old house / What does where you were born still say about you? / It’d be best to jettison what you can’t redo.’\n\nPerhaps more than on any other Real Estate record, the lyrics on In Mind seem to reflect a struggle between youth and adulthood, the desire for escapism balanced against the increasing demands of responsibility. (‘There’s no place I would rather be right now,’ sings Courtney on “Stained Glass”, ‘I’d love to never leave but I just don’t know how.’) “I feel like it takes touring a record for a few months and playing the songs over and over for me to really start understanding my own lyrics,” says Courtney, “but so much of this record feels like it has to do with my concerns about taking care of my family. I will often walk my wife and kids to the library and then just go out on my own, wandering around the town for three or four hours and writing the lyrics in my head.” Courtney continues, “We certainly never thought this would be our lives, but now that it is, we all want to protect that and nourish it and keep it safe. I think maybe that’s what this record is about.”\n\nAs for the band’s increasingly widespread appeal, both bassist Alex Bleeker and Courtney can only theorize as to what it is about their music that seems to strike such a profound chord with listeners. “I think there’s an earnestness to what we do,” says Bleeker. “It’s coming from a truthful place of human experience, but it’s also kind of raw. It evokes something for people, even though we are often dissecting subject matter that seems super normal and undramatic, it’s also relatable. We all grew up with this common, cookie-cutter kind of American suburban experience and we can’t help but write about that. I think there aren’t a lot of people who actually write about that in a very forthright way.”\n\nPer bassist Alex Bleeker, the songs on In Mind reflect a kind of quiet ambition on the part of the band. A desire not to reinvent themselves, but rather to just be the best version of themselves that they can be. “We’re never looking to overhaul anything in a huge way,” he says, “But we do want to grow and explore new territory and use the studio in a different way. We didn’t want to change anything arbitrarily, but it felt good to reach out into some more exploratory space while still holding on to what makes us Real Estate in the first place.”\n\nhttp://realestatetheband.com/",

Being based simultaneously in Toulouse, France and on stages across the world makes this electronic musician stand out. With inspirations far afield from music – a painting, the weather, a dream – in her craft, Chloé Herry’s derivations are difficult to trace. Under the broad structure of electronic and bass music, and informed by sound the world over, Clozee finds her best fit in World Bass’ corner.\n\nCloZee has performed on many continents: from Coachella to India, on four US Tours, and everywhere around her native France. She is a standout on the roster of her labels, Gravitas Recordings & Otodayo Records. Followers in many languages drive streams counted in millions. But art’s ability to transport others is this talented producer’s special magic – manifest whenever someone presses play.\n\nIn the way the clean curve of a Japanese roof is understated and exotic, CloZee pulls her power from a bold simplicity. Her classical guitar roots allow her an informed, melodic space that draws influence from flamenco to edIT of The Glitch Mob. This melting pot of instrumentation and cinematic flair puts listeners in a mood to move, with international crowds now cultivating the evolution of her genre. Chloé says she rarely lays down only electronic sounds. Her favorite sources are organic and real.\n\nTo describe her life, CloZee grins and dramatizes her mind exploding. With traction growing stateside, she is set to expand far beyond the transformational festivals and tours where she grew the same roots that nourished Bassnectar, Beats Antique, and Bonobo. CloZee is breaking through the canopy and into the sun. Come see her fly.\n\nhttp://www.clozeemusic.com/",

They have been together six years and have held a weekly residency since the beginning. The band is comprised of sidemen from some of the most respected acts in the music industry (Beyonce, Erykah Badu, Chrisette Michelle, Talib Kweli, P. Diddy, The Polyphonic Spree, etc.), yet possesses a sound distinctly separate from any of their individual projects.\n\nThe Funky Knuckles move together musically as a school of fish, never complacent and always stretching the boundaries of improvisation and composition. Whether performing original music or standards, they draw from each member’s musical experiences to create their unique genre-bending sound. After the release of their debut album on GroundUP Music, As of Lately, The Knuckles added a full-time horn section and began touring nationally.\n\nMeta-Musica (also on GroundUP), climbed the iTunes Jazz Charts to become the #1 selling record in the United States the day it was released.\n\nhttp://www.thefunkyknuckles.com/\n\nPHO is a Twin Cities funk band creating a new Minneapolis sound utilizing modern taste and classic influences to break musical boundaries.\n\nPHO released their debut album 'CASH IT' in February of 2015 and created lasting buzz for recording such a mature and creative record as early 20 year olds. They reached out to friends Alan Evans of Soulive and John Davis, producer for Lettuce/Jo Jo Mayer to help achieve a sound that would resonate internationally. They have supported and toured with bands such as The Motet, Larry Graham and GCS, Jonathan Richman, Dopapod, and Oddisee. In early Early 2016 Prince found the band via Youtube and posted about them on his social media. This sparked a huge buzz for PHO around the globe and landed them an invite to Prince's Paisley Park Studio's opening for Larry Graham. Fans are watching this band eagerly into 2017 as they predict them to be one of the bigger names of the funk/festival scene.\n\nhttp://www.phoband.com/",

Leading his flawlessly tight band with a cool confidence, Maceo transports audiences to the slickest of eras in performances that are positively timeless.

The group is comprised of some of the best talent to be heard, with varied backgrounds coming together from all over the country on bass, drums and keys.\n\nJaden Carlson, the front of JCB, with her oft face-melting prowess on the guitar as well as thought-provoking lyricism, has led many to tag her as an \"old soul\" and \"well beyond her years.\" Low in age but tour-mature, Jaden leads the music with the poise and character of a highly accomplished professional.\n\nChris Hunnicutt brings his low-end rhythm from years of gigging in the hotbed of Minneapolis gospel, funk, blues, jazz and hip-hop.\n\nEric Imbrosciano's depth of experience in blues, hip-hop, funk and jazz stems from his early years beating his drums around the New York scene before making his musical home in Colorado.\n\nAdam Revell's versatility from multi-genre influences and years of gigging with many different bands shines through in his playing the keys while providing soulful and melodic harmony on piano, organ and synthesizer.\n\nThe band has been appearing at some of the nation's most notable festivals: Summer Camp, The Friendly Gathering, The Vertex Festival,80/35, Bumbershoot, LEAF Festival, The Werkout Music and Art Festival, Jazz Aspen Snowmass, ARISE Festival, Bohemian Nights, and many others.\n\nThe Jaden Carlson Band has headlined major venues all over Colorado, as well as played direct support for national touring bands Twiddle, The Revivalists, The Werks, DeVotchKa, Robert Cray, Anders Osborne, and Marco Benevento just to name a few.\n\n\"Polychromatic\", an 11-song cd of all originals, is Jaden's fourth album and was released in October 2014, to both highly regarded journalistic and musician/peer reviews.\n\nJaden is the youngest musician to play legitimately on the the Red Rocks Stage at age 11 with Michael Franti and Spearhead, and again the next night with Blues Traveler; and has also played numerous sit-ins with Umphrey's McGee, The Revivalists, Lettuce, Dumpstaphunk, The Main Squeeze, The Nth Power, Twiddle, The Werks, TAUK, Zoogma, The Motet, Dopapod, members of Snarky Puppy, Vulfpeck, Big Gigantic, and many more.\n\nhttp://jadensound.com/\n\nSince forming in the Rustbelt of Cleveland, OH in 2010, BROCCOLI SAMURAI has been taking the club and festival scene by storm. The band's synth-laden, drum and bass influenced, progressive electronica has been thrilling audiences throughout the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast markets, winning them a massive and fiercely loyal fanbase. Eager fans pack dance floors and late-night festival sets with smiles across their faces, waiting to get lost in the band's ambient soundscapes, anticipating every bass drop that will force them to move with reckless abandon. Broccoli Samurai's line-up includes founding member Ryan \"Bruce\" Hodson on keys and synth, and Cameron Bickley on drums and percussion. Accomplished bassist Zach Wolfe anchors the rhythm section, while guitarist Michael Vincent weaves in and out, exploring new sonic territory.\n\nThe band has played countless festivals such as Peach Music Festival, Electric Forest, Catskill Chill Music Festival, Aura Music and Art Festival, The Werk Out, BIG What?!, Domefest, Paradise Music and Art Festival, Rootwire, The Mad Tea Party Jam, The Ville, SummerDance, Disc Jam, Night Lights Fall Music Festival, The Gathering At Chaffee's, Utica Music and Art Festival, and Hyperion Fest.

With his debut EP \"Fear of Perdition\", Nick Nash weaves profoundly honest lyrics with simple song structures to create relatable melodies which reflect the inner transitions from the darkness of doubt to the clarity of self-redemption. Rout with the rough edges of a mountain high-desert upbringing, with the grit of rural working class blood, smoothed with distance from mistakes of prior generations -- \"Fear of Perdition\" is as complex as it is simple. Nick is on tour beginning in July and set to release his debut full-length in the near future.",

Then, we'll break into groups, get our hands dirty and do your part to get the St. Vrain looking pristine.  Prizes will be offered to volunteers that collect the most trash and find the most unique items along the river.\n\nBOATERS WELCOME. To give the river the love that it needs we want to get people picking up trash from both along the bike trail and on the river. If you'd like to boat, we ask that you bring your own boating gear (rafts and duckies work best for picking up trash) and proper safety equipment. Avid4 Adventure has provided a van to assist with shuttling folks back to the Apple Valley launch site after the cleanup. Please sign the Avid4 Adventure waiver located on the volunteer registration prior to the cleanup day.\n\nAfter the cleanup, we'll head to Oskar Blues Grill & Brew for some brews and apps on the patio. Each volunteer will receive one FREE Oskar Blues Brewery core beer.\n\nCome on show some love for Mama Earth!",

    "description": "Rooster Magazine & Party Guru Productions Present\nKing Lil G with GoonieGangMusic (Swizzy J), RhymeSight at Fox Theatre\n\nDoors - 8:30 PM\nShow - 9:00 PM\nAll Ages\nhttp://www.foxtheatre.com/event/1467687\nVIP Tickets - https://soundrink.com/app#/event/king-lil-g-6-30-boulder-co\n\nOn the surface, King Lil G is a rebel. He's been involved in gangs, he's been arrested and served time, he fathered a child before adulthood, he dropped out of school and, to match his record, his body is covered in tattoos. But beyond his troubled past and rough exterior, G is a true artist with a message of HOPE.\n\nBorn and raised in Los Angeles, California by his single Mexican mother, King Lil G turned to the streets shortly after his parents divorced when he was 12. Soon enough, gang activity would catch up with him, landing him in Juvenile Hall and then house arrest. But G didn't let the imprisonment discourage him, instead, he used the time to reflect, finding solace in writing rhymes.\n\nInspired by his own struggles, trials and tribulations that had shaped him, G looked no further than his own life for material. With no formal training or music background, he began to self-teach and, as a result, master the art of storytelling in its most raw, honest and simplest form of wordsmithing. Additionally, he was influenced by the G-funk flavor of 90s West Coast rap about women, weed and palm trees, especially that of California hip-hop staples Snoop Dogg, Too $hort and Dr. Dre, among others, as well as Mexican folk ballads called corridos music and the passion and emotion of one of his all-time favorites, Tupac.\n\n\"I wanted to rap about the struggle - real street stuff that I was going through,\" says King Lil G of his gangster hip-hop sound. \"I also started reading, including a book called Quotationary (Leonard Roy Frank)... [which] inspired me to write a lot of the songs I write now. It taught me a lot about friends, women and family.\"\n\nAnd, in the bigger scheme of things, G hoped to inspire others to stray away from committing some of the same mistakes he made and instead strive to achieve their goals and dreams, just as he was attempting to do then. His mentality was, and continues to be, if he can make it so can anyone. Furthermore, if he can use his platform, however small or big it may be, to help others, then that's exactly what he plans to do.\n\n\"There are so many things I want to do, but to begin with I want to do a lot of things for kids... not just the kids that aren't healthy, but how about kids that have no hope?\" G explains. \"The ones that can get help but don't have money and parents don't know a way to help them out. I want to be that person.\"\n\nWith this goal in mind, Lil G compiled a slew of his best music and released it via the mixtape Blue Devil 2 in 2011CK, followed by his second release, King Enemy, in 2012CK, and before he knew it, he had gained a sizable viral buzz and hardcore, loyal fan base (currently he has over 43k+ followers on Twitter, over 359k+ likes on Facebook, 192k+ subscribers to his YouTube channel and 301k+ followers on Instagram).\n\nHe began performing locally while quietly building an army of fans across the country. Today, he's selling out performances around the country. His fans came in a myriad of colors and shapes, from Mexicans to Whites to Blacks and others, and his word began to make its round and stick with even the unlikeliest of listener. He made the hopeless feel hopeful and the grittiest of gang banger feel like today was a better day, maybe even good enough to put the gun down and seek a different path, a more positive one, much like G did.\n\nIt was this very appeal that made Lil G a hot commodity to labels and, as a result, in 2012 he was scouted by and signed a joint venture deal with MIH Entertainment. With a bigger machine to help him spread his message of optimism and promise, and motivated by his vastly growing popularity, King Lil G created the Sucio (Spanish for \"dirty\") Movement, which, in his own words, is \"a positive movement that has to do with freedom and not being afraid to accomplish and do things... it's empowerment for those that don't think they can make it and come from nothing.\"\n\nSimilarly, his latest project, AK47Boyz, hopes to motivate and inspire. Unlike what might initially come to mind when reading the title, the reference to an AK 47 riffle represents \"power and knowledge,\" says G. \"It means do whatever you want. When you figure out that person out there is not smarter than you yet that person is doing great things, you will see that you can, too. This is what I want to open people's eyes to.\"\n\nReleased last March, AK47Boyz is his most well-received album to date; it's been downloaded over 36,000 times on Datpiff.com, with 128k views to date. Songs like Hopeless Boy, a true-to-life depiction of his bout with drug dealing and going through financial hardships, finds King Lil G rapping, \"Motherfucker, I had guns in my mother's closet, the day she caught me, tear drops started falling / then she slapped me in the face, looking broken-hearted, how the fuck do I explain that my hood is stronger?\" over a looping snare and static drums by NutKase. An accompanying video was shot and will be released soon.\n\nEl Alpachino, with a church-like chorus topped by double-speed drums helmed by Five Oh Trez, compares G's own life to that of the character of Al Pacino from the movie Scarface. \"He came from nothing and made his story happen by linking with people,\" explains G. \"Like when he was working at the sandwich shop and then built his way up - that's my life and a lot of people can relate to that.\"\n\nMeanwhile, there's Love Kills, a sexy number about unfaithfulness and relationship woes, atop a galactic production by AAP Jermz Jedi Keyz and featuring Krypto, and Joey and Jasmine, \"a song that teaches the difference between a hoe and a good woman,\" says G bluntly. Other producers include Drummer Boy and Lewis Parker and guest appearances from David Ortiz and LA Gun Smoke, among others.\n\n\"I want to make music with a purpose,\" closes King Lil G. \"I want to inspire others. It'd be beautiful. How much of a difference would it make if a hardcore gang member would be like, 'let's not kill today, let's change our lives'? As my career goes on, I want to keep pushing this positive vibe... and if I start helping others, that will make me successful.\"\n\nMusic saved King Lil G. Now, the reality rapper is ready to pay it forward\n\nhttp://www.kinglilg.com/",

Phil began playing under the moniker Phil Lesh and Friends in 1998, after he'd returned to performing following the death of his friend and bandmate Jerry Garcia in 1995. With a varied mixture of some of the best performing musicians in the live music universe, Phil has kept his musical journey fresh by constantly and consistently putting together bands featuring dynamic, exciting musicians and singers working together toward keeping the music of the Grateful Dead moving forward into the future.\n\nFormed from weekly shows at Phil's Terrapin Crossroads in San Rafael, CA, the Terrapin Family Band has become the venue's official house band. Terrapin Crossroads' constant free bar shows, often featuring bandleader Phil, have created an opportunity for the young musicians of Terrapin Crossroads to perform together and with a diverse cast of visiting musicians. Through playing in this setting, and with ongoing mentoring from Phil, the Terrapin Family Band has grown into a richly nuanced and fun band, weaving the classics with obscure covers and fresh original music to create a unique musical tapestry.\n\nTickets are on sale at Boulder Theater Box Office, by phone at (303)-786-7030 or online at www.foxtheatre.com",

Bruce Hampton, who’s made a lifelong impact on the members of the band. All graduates of the “University of Bruce Hampton”, The Invisible Whip are longtime friends.

Beautiful soaring violin melodies, and deep rhythmic bass synth lines drive each musical passage through every member of the audience. Band members Michael Mahan, Jessica Borth, and Rob Brandon work in unity gripping the crowd for a show that is both mesmerizing and captivating from start to finish.

Phil began playing under the moniker Phil Lesh and Friends in 1998, after he'd returned to performing following the death of his friend and bandmate Jerry Garcia in 1995. With a varied mixture of some of the best performing musicians in the live music universe, Phil has kept his musical journey fresh by constantly and consistently putting together bands featuring dynamic, exciting musicians and singers working together toward keeping the music of the Grateful Dead moving forward into the future.\n\nFormed from weekly shows at Phil's Terrapin Crossroads in San Rafael, CA, the Terrapin Family Band has become the venue's official house band. Terrapin Crossroads' constant free bar shows, often featuring bandleader Phil, have created an opportunity for the young musicians of Terrapin Crossroads to perform together and with a diverse cast of visiting musicians. Through playing in this setting, and with ongoing mentoring from Phil, the Terrapin Family Band has grown into a richly nuanced and fun band, weaving the classics with obscure covers and fresh original music to create a unique musical tapestry.\n\nTickets are on sale at Boulder Theater Box Office, by phone at (303)-786-7030 or online at www.foxtheatre.com",

When escalating anger toward the injustices, historical and current, inflicted upon the Lakota people by the federal government leads to tribal divisions and infighting, the cousins go in separate directions: Rick chooses the path of peace; You Choose, violence. A complex tale that spans generations and geography, Quiet Until the Thaw conjures the implications of an oppressed history, how we are bound to all who have come before and will come after us, and, most of all, to the notion that everything is always connected.\n\nVouchers to attend are $10 and are good for $5 off Quiet Until the Thaw. Vouchers can be purchased now at the store, at the Library, over the phone, or at the door (if there are seats still available). Part of voucher proceeds will be donated to the Library Foundation.",

    "category": "MUSIC",
    "description": "\"Jam Band\" Pioneers, The Williams Brothers Band will be in Boulder for the weekend to perform at the Bolder Boulder, but first in true \"pre-party\" form they are grabbing up some old friends in the area and putting down a true old school jam fest at Owsley's ..... featuring guest appearance \"sit ins\" from members of Atomga, Potcheen, Tight Thump and more tba.\nThis night will be unforgettable..... Looking forward to the get down! \n\n~ THE WILLIAMS BROTHERS were molded on the streets of Oakland, California during the seventies (the only \"white boys\" on Salisbury Street) listening to their parents vast blues & country vinyl collection, the funk that flowed out of boomboxes (pre hip-hop), and the psychedelic folk rock that blossomed in the East Bay Area during that time. So it was inevitable that the brothers followed their families lineage of song and dance men(Gr,Gr,Gr,Great Grandpa penned the traditional favorite, \"Sweet Betsy from Pike\" in mid 1800's. Gr,Gr,Grandpa had a country swing big band that toured the US extensively in the 1910s-1920s), After moving to Roseville, Ca the brothers started putting together their first groups in the mid-eighties. (Uncle John's Band, 922, The Homegrown Boogie Band).\n\nA WILLIAMS BROTHERS show features intertwining songs and extended improv induced jams fueled by any and all audatory stimulus to have ever sounded, there is no genre or barrier that is considered unusuable, all previous artists are an influence in one way or another, it is true old school original jam music. JAMES WILLIAMS vocals are inspired by the grit of JIM MORRISON, the soul of OTIS REDDING and the personal experience of JERRY GARCIA. PHILLIP WILLIAMS plays lead guitar with a deep blues style that is noticeably influenced by JIMI HENDRIX, STEVIE RAY VAUGHN & DUANE ALLMAN. Whether solo, together as \"ACOUSTIC WB\" or with their back-up group THE HOMEGROWN BOOGIE BAND, WILLIAMS BROTHERS shows are always full of surprises & special guests. it is never the same show twice\n\nTHE WILLIAMS BROTHERS & THEIR HOMEGROWN BOOGIE BAND moved to western Colorado in 2000 where they have established themselves as the anchor of the western Colorado music scene. Over the past 27+ years The Williams Brothers Band have helped start several music venues (of all genres), put together some of the earliest homegrown \"jam band\" festivals, and have tirelessly promoted the genre. \n\nAfter 10+ years as one of the founding members of the \"jamband\" scene in northern California, James \"Papa Bear\" Williams snatched up his younger brother Phil & moved to Colorado in 2000. Since then THE WILLIAMS BROTHERS BAND has established themselves as the anchor of the music scene in Western Colorado.  The Williams Brothers are true purveyors of american music and cross genres with ease and proficiency, nearing almost 30 years performing. TWBB has played every major festival & venue west of the MIssissippi & have worked with: RAMBLIN' JACK ELLIOT, LITTLE FEAT, JERRY GARCIA BAND, DEREK TRUCKS, LOS LONELY BOYS, BLIND MELON, THE LUMINEERS, JASON ISBELL, RUSTED ROOT, DREW EMMITT, VINCE HERMAN, LOTUS, JOE CRAVEN, CANNED HEAT, THE SAMPLES, JO JO HERMAN, MOTHER HIPS, JOHN BROWN'S BODY, JERRY JOSEPH, RECKLESS KELLY, LUKAS NELSON, LONDON SOULS, TONY FURTADO, OZOMATLI,  NEW MONSOON, HOT BUTTERED RUM, ZUVUYA, GREAT AMERICAN TAXI, THAMUSEMEANT, SAM KININGER, CAROLYN WONDERLAND, WILLY TEA TAYLOR, CARLOS WASHINGTON, DAVID GANS, DELTA NOVE, THE MOTET just to name a few.",

    "description": "In partnership with Comedy Works Entertainment\n\nFrom his bio:\nBrad Williams possesses something that everyone can agree is funny: a disability. Brad is a dwarf. He has appeared on numerous TV shows including Mind Of Mencia, Live at Gotham, the Tonight Show, Jimmy Kimmel Live, and Pitboss. Brad has also performed for the troops all over the world because soldiers think dwarfs are funny too.\n\nBrad was born and raised in Orange County, CA. He dropped out of college and started doing comedy at the age of 19. He toured as Carlos Mencia’s opening act for 5 years. Brad’s big break came when he would appear in numerous sketches on Comedy Central’s Mind Of Mencia TV show. Brad’s memorable roles on the show include playing a whore dwarf (“whorf”), the leader of an all dwarf basketball team, joining Mencia at a Renaissance faire, and giving a speech about his hatred of podiums.\n\nBrad’s show is high energy. Robin Williams called him “Prozac with a head.” Brad’s ability to make humorous observations on disability, relationships, sex, and race are winning over audiences and proving that anyone can overcome their shortcomings. Brad’s new hour special, “Fun Size”, premieres May 8, 2015 on SHOWTIME.\n\n[no one under 18 admitted to comedy shows]",

We also wanted to keep it casual, so that folks can chat, as well as openly react to any of the performances. And the performances should be less restricted and formal, with the understanding that only grownups who aren't easily offended would be there, ready for whatever happens next.\n\nJames looked into prohibition-era speakeasy culture, and the psuedonym Blind Tiger came up, which definitely evokes the wild, beautiful, and unexpected, at the risk of lacking clear direction. Just what we were looking for.\"\n\nOn the bill:\n\nEspresso, gypsy jazz and American swing\nStand-up with Kevin Klatman and Cody Spyker \nSpoken word with Andy Schneidkraut \nGender-queer cabaret with Katie Woodzick \nShort films by Justin Bogardus and Richard Fleming \nall this, and more!\n\nTickets: https://tickets.thedairy.org/Online/BlindTiger",

The photographs explore not only the nation's communal gatherings, but also the social harmony generated by community involvement and the shared experience of participating and performing in these events.\n\nNoted neurobiologist Steven Pinker suggests that stereoscopic vision is \"a paradigm of how the mind works.\" Extending this theory to the work in Beyond Thought, Steve Mason's creation of 3D imagery in aluminum prints allows the artist to deconstruct aspects of visual processing and use it to better understand how we see. While the prints evolved from the artist's figurative drawings, snapshots, and paintings, they are ultimately abstract in form. \n\nThe Dairy respectfully suggests a $5 donation for visiting our galleries.",

When escalating anger toward the injustices, historical and current, inflicted upon the Lakota people by the federal government leads to tribal divisions and infighting, the cousins go in separate directions: Rick chooses the path of peace; You Choose, violence. A complex tale that spans generations and geography, Quiet Until the Thaw conjures the implications of an oppressed history, how we are bound to all who have come before and will come after us, and, most of all, to the notion that everything is always connected.\n\nVouchers to attend are $10 and are good for $5 off Quiet Until the Thaw. Vouchers can be purchased now at the store, at the Library, over the phone, or at the door (if there are seats still available). Part of voucher proceeds will be donated to the Library Foundation.",

    "description": "21+\n\nThe Heavy Pets are an American rock band whose contagious vibe blends rhythm and blues, jazz-funk, nu-disco and reggae fusion with rock & roll. Called \"a living, breathing, force of nature\" by Relix Magazine, the Pets are known for their soulful song-craft and the powerhouse live performances of their infectious dance songs. Riding high on their most recent studio effort, the A/B single Stolen Smile, look out for The Heavy Pets as they continue to hit the road hard.\n\nThe group became an instant Sirius radio sensation in 2007 with the release of their doubledisc debut album, Whale, driven by hit tracks \"Operation of Flight\" and \"Sleep.\" First embraced by the jam scene for their raw talent, their crossover sound that is showcased on their self-titled album, also dubbed a \"Top 10 Album of 2010\" by The Huffington Post, propelled them into the periphery of mainstream music. Returning to their acoustic roots on Swim Out Past the Sun (2011), THP's guitar duo set aside their electric axes for a more organic approach. The Heavy Pets followed up those polished efforts by releasing the Everywhere Sessions: Volume 1 EP, recorded live in the studio with accompanying videos of the three songs \"Chew,\" \"Help Me Help You\" and \"The Day the Sun Forgot to Rise.\"\n\nMajor festival darlings, THP have taken the stage at Bonnaroo, Jam Cruise, High Sierra, Gathering of the Vibes, All Good, Wakarusa, Mountain Jam, Bear Creek, Summer Camp, Catskill Chill, AURA and their namesake PetZoo",

Through this process, she explored the common language of visual art and music, creating ensembles that embody the essence of music. \n\nIn his paintings in Seriously Audacious Situational Surrealism, Hone Williams creates strange and surreal compositions inspired by real world situations, resulting in perplexing views of realkity or perhaps pseudo-reality - dimensional reality, fictional reality, or the other side of reality. \n\nThis reception is presented in conjunction with the Dairy's Third Thursday event, featuring music by Purple Squirrel. \n\nWe respectfully suggest a donation of $5 per person when you visit our galleries.",

You won't want to miss it!\n \nDoors: 6:00pm\nShow Start: 7:00pm\nShow End: 9:00pm\n\nDrew Holcomb and the Neighbors\n\nDrew Holcomb and The Neighbors is an Americana band from Memphis and East Nashville, TN. Formed in 2006 by Drew Holcomb (lead vocals, guitar, harmonica), the band includes Nathan Dugger (guitar, keys), Rich Brinsfield (bass), Jonathan Womble (drums), and Grant Pittman (keys).\nDrawing influence from Tom Petty and Bob Dylan, Drew Holcomb and The Neighbors has found their place in today’s landscape of singer/songwriter Americana. Drew and his band have developed their sound through extensive touring, performing alongside John Hiatt, Don Henley, The Avett Brothers, Ryan Adams, Los Lobos, Susan Tedeschi, Needtobreathe, Robert Earl Keen and more.\nThe band has sold over 100,000 albums to date, and played over 1,800 concert dates in 7 countries. Their songs have received 40 TV placements, appearing on How I Met Your Mother, Criminal Minds, Parenthood, Nashville, HOUSE, Justified and more.\nThe band’s latest studio record, Souvenir, is set for release on March 24, 2017.\n\nTift Merritt\n\nAs 2015 began, I had somehow been on the road for the fastest, longest two years of my life. I had kicked the tires hard touring in support of my album Traveling Alone. I had recorded and toured with classical pianist Simone Dinnerstein. My friend Andrew Bird asked me to be in his old time band the Hands of Glory, so I pretended I was a member of the Carter family on guitar, and I watched him like a hawk to make sure he felt fully free; singing harmony with Andrew is not unlike flying. Suddenly, I was turning 40, getting divorced, and scared out of my mind. So I decided to take a year off the road to see what would happen to me if I just stopped touring… On a friend's ranch in Marfa, Texas, in the middle of the high plains without a car headlight in sight, I did just that, and when I did, I started to do what I always do: the humble work of marking life by writing.\n\nOn the ranch, I wrote about the long straight roads in west Texas: the ones that make sense, that make you feel like what is behind you is indeed behind you and that good things are up ahead. 'Wait For Me' is a wish that life would run like that. Watching the ranch hands keep their daily routine, I wrote about keeping my own head down, pressing on, and the way that love persists and pushes forward no matter what happens, 'Love Soldiers On.' I watched birds learning to fly and bathe in the driveway dust at dusk in the front yard and wrote 'Icarus' about what they taught me. In my California cabin, I wrote every morning and hiked every afternoon, up the mountains to the East and along the rocky coast, farther than I had ever hiked, one exhausted foot after the other. 'Heartache is an Uphill Climb' began in the red mud on one particularly impossible incline. Once, having hiked farther than I realized, dark fell on me. The white lilies in a meadow began to glow like evening dresses as the moon rose in the changing light. 'Proclamation Bones' is a tribute to that unexpected beauty, to nature's secret nightlife. On return to NYC with Raymond Carver's All of Us: The Collected Poems in hand, his poem 'My Boat' leapt up like lightning; it wanted to be sung. In a hungover moment of joy coming out of a subway, 'Something Came Over Me' seeded itself. And the heavy sadness of memory washing over me as I looked out at the East River became 'Eastern Light'.\n\nLook, everyone knows that album bios are usually full of crap. How about this: This album weathered no doubt, Marlon Brando's ghost played bass and a fire-breathing dragon co-wrote the songs! Let's be clear about something – What made my time off special was that I had a regular writing routine. I was private. I followed my heart and my craft. The story of being a writer is the story of being devoted over a long time. What I hate most about bios is that they trade the small virtue of the writing life for pretending that artists and albums spring forth fully formed, trimming the tale to fit the spotlight. I'm more comfortable being real about things. I took my life and synthesized it through my writing with an intensity that no one but the birds saw but that hopefully you can feel. And life continued. Let the real story here be that there is love and beauty in the mess of dedication.\n\nAnd life did continue. In Fall, my friend MC Taylor asked me to be a part of his new Hiss Golden Messenger album. About the same time, to my delight and surprise, I realized my boyfriend and I were expecting a child. I performed with HGM just as I began to show; MC and his band talked on and on about how North Carolina was a place you could actually raise a child AND be a musician. My roots and my friends pulled. In an airport, I bumped into my friend Sam Beam. He said I could send him my songs, and when I did and he said, \"I can tell you've been working hard on your writing,\" I was filled with the gratefulness which comes from being heard. I couldn't believe he wanted in on the record making party, along with my favorite musicians, for four days because that was what I could afford. One long night before leaving for the studio, I stared at the ceiling of my NYC apartment. The leaves, the streetlights, and the sirens drew a shadow vine. I cried for dreams that were gone, and I gathered myself for those to come. I recorded in Los Angeles six months pregnant and then set off for home to figure out what a onesie was. I showed up back in my hometown knocked about a little by the world thinking maybe my life was a country song, but maybe it was a really good country song.\n\nWhat strikes me most when I am writing these days is the changing nature of things. Sometimes sex matters deeply, sometimes family eclipses all; sometimes aloneness is hell, sometimes it is a refuge. Sometimes hometowns are constricting; sometimes they are a sight for sore eyes. We do our damnedest.\nFor all the times we are watered down and compromise, we can become rigid and impossible just as easily. We right ourselves as best we can and carry on. It is a loose thread that holds us best together in this life. Not too tight, not too planned, enough give to stand what tangles us but ties us nonetheless. Ties us to each other in some unseen pattern, to our actions, to the songs that come out of us, to the seasons that pass through us. We press on, love persists, and we must trust the unknowable pattern we are making. My little daughter is sleeping beside me now, and what I hope for her is what I will tell you now. May these threads be joyful; not heavy chains, but light like wings, like starlight, like laughter. Empty your pockets of stones, that light-hearted you may go (for you must go), with the stitch of the world, into the stitch of the world.",

    "description": "'The Tibetan Book of Health: Sowa Rigpa, the Science of Healing'\n\nPublic Talk and Book Signing in Boulder, Colorado wtih Dr Nida Chenagtsang, internationally renowned Tibetan doctor, Buddhist teacher, and author. \n\nSowa Rigpa (Tib. གསོ་བ་རིག་པ་), the ‘Science of Healing’, is the medical system of Tibet and other Himalayan regions including Bhutan, Nepal, Ladakh, Sikkim, and Mongolia. It is one of the oldest healing traditions in existence, yet it remains fully alive and intact even today. Incorporated elements from the foreign medical systems of India, China, and Ancient Greece it retains its own distinctly Himalayan character, shaped by both Buddhist and pre-Buddhist thought. Sowa Rigpa is a truly holistic system of medicine that approaches the total health of the individual from the perspective of physical body, energy, and mind and has the fourfold aim of preventing illness, curing illness, extending life, and cultivating happiness.\n\nAbout the author:\n\nDr. Nida Chenagtsang was born in Amdo, in Eastern Tibet. Interested in the traditional healing science of his people, he began his early medical studies at the local Tibetan Medicine hospital. Later he gained scholarship entry to Lhasa Tibetan Medical University, where he completed his medical education in 1996. Dr. Nida completed his practical training at the Tibetan Medicine hospitals in Lhasa and Lhoka.\n\nDr. Nida has published many articles and books on Sowa Rigpa (Traditional Tibetan Medicine). He has extensively researched ancient Tibetan healing methods, and has gained high acclaim in the East and West for his revival of traditional Tibetan external healing therapies.\n\nDr. Nida is the Co-Founder and Medical Director of Sorig Khang International (www.sorig.net) formerly the International Academy for Traditional Tibetan Medicine). He is also the Co-Founder of the International Ngak-mang Institute, established to preserve and maintain the Rebkong Ngakpa yogic culture within modern Tibetan society. Dr. Nida trains students in Sowa Rigpa and the Yuthok Nyingthig spiritual tradition in over 40 countries around the world.\n\nFor information about Dr Nida's three day teaching program in Boulder, Colorado June 24 - 26, please visit: www.bouldervalleyngakpahouse.com\n\nFor more information about Dr Nida and his publications, please visit: www.skypressbooks.com",

    "description": "#ChainStation \n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ChainStation/\n\nChain Station is a 4-piece, high-energy, get 'em out on the dance floor string band from the front range of Colorado's Rocky Mountains. They've become known for catchy and lyrically-poignant original songs that flow from the mountains, through them and right back to you! Pure Mountain Music!\nThe music of Chain Station is well-steeped in Americana roots. Their vocal harmonies are high, lonesome, and tight. Their picking ranges from lightning-fast to mountain mellow. They are a bluegrass band that would satisfy a picky old-timer and delight fans of newgrass, a delicate balance indeed.\n\nTheir live shows have become that of legend, with energy and stage antics that guarantee one hell of a night out. Equally comfortable rocking a concert hall, a packed club, or a mountain holler, this band gets after it...with style.\n\nThe boys— Alex Thoele on guitar and vocals, Jarett Mason on mandolin and vocals, Jon Pickett on bass and vocals, and James Weatherly on banjo— are on a summer tour to support their album Dancin’ With the Law. Chain Station also released a followup live album July 2015, Chain Up Volume I Live, available at live shows only. The group has warmed up for notables the Travelin’ McCourys, The Devil Makes Three and Todd Snider.",

    "name": "Sarah Jarosz + James McMurtry at Boulder Theater",
    "category": "MUSIC_EVENT",
    "description": "105.5 The Colorado Sound Present\nSARAH JAROSZ + JAMES MCMURTRY\nBOULDER THEATER\nFriday, July 21, 2017\nDoors:  7:00 pm | Show:  8:00 pm\nTickets on sale 10 a.m. Friday, April 14, 2017 at bouldertheater.com. \n$25.00 GA | $30.00 RES plus applicable service charges\n\nAbout Sarah Jarosz: With her fourth album, Undercurrent, Sarah Jarosz makes a studied departure from her previous records, shifting the emphasis from her skills as a multi-instrumentalist to her songwriting and vocal performance. Undercurrent accentuates the growth and maturity that Jarosz, now 25, has achieved since graduating from New England Conservatory and moving to New York City. The change in approach garnered Jarosz two Grammy Awards in 2017-for Best Folk Album Year for Undercurrent and for Best American Roots Performance for \"House Of Mercy\". She also picked up the award for 2017 Folk Album of the Year from Folk Alliance International for Undercurrent.\n\nOn Undercurrent, Jarosz delivers a set of all-original songs, centered around four solo pieces that set the tone of the record. Uncut Magazine describes it as \"an enthralling journey from source to mouth,\" and goes on to say \"These are songs about the choices we make, the paths we take and the things we leave behind, a deep meditation on the invisible currents that guide us.\" The Wall Street Journal notes \"This economical approach brings the listener closer to Ms. Jarosz than on any of her previous recordings, and it suits the lyrical theme of passion that, mostly, is forbidden and unrequited.\"\n\nThe Austin Chronicle's Jim Caligiuri declared \"For Austinites who've followed her since her early teens, the fact that Wimberley native Sarah Jarosz blossomed into one of the most stirring musicians of her generation comes as absolutely no surprise,\" while Consequence of Sound''s Michelle Geslani noted the \"startling sense of insight\" in Jarosz's compositions. NPR's Katie Presley made note of Jarosz's newfound maturity, praising her \"uncharacteristically (and deliciously) unyielding\" vocal carriage.\n\nAbout James McMurtry: James McMurtry spins stories with a poet’s pen (“Long Island Sound”) and a painter’s precision (“She Loves Me”). Proof: The acclaimed songwriter’s newComplicated Game. McMurtry’s first collection in six years spotlights a craftsman in absolutely peak form as he turns from political toward personal (“These Things I’ve Come to Know,” “You Got to Me”). “The lyrical theme is mostly about relationships,” McMurtry says. “It’s also a little about the big old world verses the poor little farmer or fisherman. I never make a conscious decision about what to write about.”\n\nComplicated Game delivers McMurtry’s trademark story songs time and again (“Copper Canteen,” “Deaver’s Crossing”), but the record brings a new (and certainly no less energetic) sonic approach. First, recall blistering beats and gnashing guitars from his magnum opus Just Us Kids (2008). Now, unplug. “The label head wanted more acoustic,” McMurtry explains. “We built everything as we went so we ended up with more acoustic guitar as we went. We just played whatever sounded right for a given song, but we weren’t necessarily saying this is an acoustic record.”\nExhibit A: “How’m I Gonna Find You Now.” The record’s lead single boasts buoyant banjos and driving drums as endlessly energetic as anything electrified. Whiplash vocals further frenzy the beat. “I've got a cup of black coffee so I don't get lazy/I've got a rattle in the dashboard driving me crazy,” McMurtry effectively raps. “If I hit it with my fist, it’ll quit for a little while/Gonna have to stop to smoke in another mile/Headed into town gonna meet you at the mercantile/Take you to the Sonic get you grinning like a crocodile.”\n\nSuch vibrant vignettes consistently turn heads. They have for a quarter century now. Clearly, he’s only improving with time. “James McMurtry is one of my very few favorite songwriters on Earth and these days he's working at the top of his game,” says Americana all-star Jason Isbell. “He has that rare gift of being able to make a listener laugh out loud at one line and choke up at the next. I don’t think anybody writes better lyrics.” “James writes like he's lived a lifetime,” echoes iconic roots rocker John Mellencamp. Yes. Spin “South Dakota.” You’ll hear.\n\nFurther evidence: McMurtry’s Just Us Kids (2008) and Childish Things (2005). The former earned his highest Billboard 200 chart position in nearly two decades and notched Americana Music Award nominations. Meanwhile, Childish Things scored endless critical praise and spent six full weeks topping the Americana Music Radio chart in 2005 and 2006. In 2006, Childish Things won the Americana Music Association’s Album of the Year and “We Can’t Make It Here” was named the rapidly rising organization's Song of the Year.\n\nOf course, Complicated Game doubles down on literate storytelling longtime enthusiasts expect. Recall high watermarks past: “Childish Things,” “Choctaw Bingo,” “Peter Pan,” “Levelland,” and “Out Here in the Middle” only begin the list. (Yes, Robert Earl Keen covered those last two, “Levelland” remaining a live staple.) Just Us Kidsalone includes fan favorites “Hurricane Party,” “Ruby and Carlos” and “You’d a Thought.” High watermarks deliver equal measures depth and breadth and pierce hearts with sharp sociopolitical commentary (“Fireline Road”).\n\nMore history: McMurtry critically lauded first album Too Long in the Wasteland (1989) was produced by John Mellencamp and marked the beginning of a series of acclaimed projects for Columbia and Sugar Hill Records. In 1996, McMurtry received a Grammy nomination for Long Form Music Video for Where'd You Hide the Body. Additionally, It Had to Happen (1997) received the American Indie Award for Best Americana Album.\n\nIn 2004, McMurtry released the universally lauded Live in Aught-Three on Compadre Records. The following year, Childish Things notched arguably his most critical praise, spending six weeks at No. 1 on the Americana Music Radio Chart in 2005 and 2006. In September 2006, Childish Things and “We Can’t Make It Here” won the Americana Music Awards for Album and Song of the Year, respectively. McMurtry received more Americana Music Award nominations for 2008’s Just Us Kids. This album marked his highest Billboard 200 chart position in more than nearly two decades.\n\nIn 2009, Live in Europe was released, capturing the McMurtry band’s first European tour and extraordinary live set. Along with seasoned band members Ronnie Johnson, Daren Hess, and Tim Holt, the disc features special guests Ian McLagan (The Faces) and Jon Dee Graham (True Believers, Skunks). Also, for the first time ever, video of the James McMurtry Band’s live performance is available on the included DVD.\n\nThe poignant lyrics of his immense catalog still ring true today. In 2011, “We Can’t Make It Here” was cited among The Nation’s “Best Protest Songs Ever.” “‘We Can’t Make It Here,’” Bob Lefsetz wrote, “has stood the test of time because of its unmitigated truth.”\n\nMcMurtry tours year round and consistently throws down unparalleled powerhouse performances. The Washington Post notes: “Much attention is paid to James McMurtry’s lyrics and rightfully so: He creates a novel’s worth of emotion and experience in four minutes of blisteringly stark couplets. What gets overlooked, however, is that he’s an accomplished rock guitar player ... serious stuff, imparted by a singularly serious band.”\n\n\nThe Lounge at The Boulder Theater is now open Tuesday – Saturday and on event nights from 5:00 p.m. – 11:00 p.m. The Lounge at the Boulder Theater specializes in locally sourced small plates, fine wines, craft cocktails and microbrews.

    "description": "KGNU Community Radio Presents\nAN EVENING WITH \nMARK O’CONNOR FEAT. THE O’CONNOR BAND\nBOULDER THEATER\nTuesday, June 27, 2017\nDoors:  7:00 pm | Show:  8:00 pm\nTickets on sale 10 a.m. Friday, March 17, 2017,  at bouldertheater.com. \n$25.00-$30.00 RES plus applicable service charges\n\nIt’s 8:40 p.m. on a Friday evening, five minutes before the O’Connor Band is slated to make their Grand Ole Opry debut. Fiddle legend Mark O’Connor is standing just offstage, wearing his trademark Fedora hat, smiling at the sight of the crowd, the lights, and his old friends in the Opry house band.\n\n“It’s amazing to come full circle and return here,” says O’Connor. “I first performed on this stage when I was 12. Even though it was more than 40 years ago, I’ll always vividly remember Roy Acuff introducing me to the crowd. But this performance might be even more special, because I get to have my family out there on stage with me.”\n\nAs if on cue, Mark’s son, Forrest, walks up in earnest.\n\n“Dad, we may have a slight problem,” says the younger O’Connor, wielding a mandolin in his left hand and a pick in his right. “I just realized that both our songs are in [the key of] E. Is that okay, or do we need to swap one of them out?”\n\n“Whoops,” says Mark. “Well, at this point, let’s stick with what we decided, because I think the songs are different enough. I bet the audience will love ‘em!”\n\nWithin minutes, the full six-piece O’Connor Band is out on stage, launching into a cover of the old Osborne Brothers hit, “Ruby, Are You Mad At Your Man?” Forrest’s fiancée, Kate Lee (vocals, fiddle), is singing lead, and Mark’s wife, Maggie (vocals, fiddle), is chopping rhythm on the fiddle hard enough that, if you weren’t looking, you might think she was playing a snare drum. Joe Smart (guitar) and Geoff Saunders (bass) are also holding down a tight groove despite the breakneck pace. After a virtuosic vocal performance from Kate and blistering solos from father and son O’Connor, the song ends abruptly, and the audience erupts in what seems to be the loudest applause of the entire evening.\n\n \nFor more information about this show, please contact \nDarlene D’Agostino Beck at Darlene@z2ent.com. \nTickets are on sale at Boulder Theater Box Office, by phone at (303)-786-7030 or online at www.bouldertheater.com",

    "description": "KGNU Community Radio & Rooster Magazine Present\nTeebs (BRAINFEEDER) with FREE THE ROBOTS, LEFTO, The Orcastrator at Fox Theatre\n\nDoors - 8:30 PM\nShow - 9:00 PM\nADV: $12.00 DOS: $15.00 + $2.00 for Under 21\nAll Ages\nhttp://www.foxtheatre.com/event/1469048-teebs-boulder/\n\nHypnotic. Warm. Organic. Tumbling. Pastoral. Ramshackle. Blissful. Expansive.\n\nThese are just some of the words that have been used to describe the work of Mtendere Mandowa, better known as Teebs.\nA producer, a painter, and a key member of Brainfeeder clan, recent years have seen Teebs surge toward the top of the so-called “beat scene”, and though his affiliation with Flying Lotus certainly has something to do with his ascent, it’s ultimately the music – a billowing brand of beautifully off-kilter, hip-hop-colored beat construction – that has set Mandowa apart from what has become an increasingly crowded field of like-mind producers.\n\nTeebs now makes his home in Northeast Los Angeles, but the 26-year-old producer wasn’t always an Angeleno. Born in the Bronx, Mandowa’s childhood also included time spent in Georgia and Hartford, Connecticut before his family switched coasts, stopping in Monterey Park, California before settling into the cozy LA suburb of Chino Hills. It was there that Teebs first truly took shape as an artist; he began painting in 2005 and started making music shortly thereafter, both by himself and as part of a collective known as My Hollow Drum.\n\nIt didn’t take long for people to take notice. Around this time, Teebs linked up with online radio stronghold Dublab, and quickly saw his network increase exponentially. In 2008, he was invited to come to Barcelona and participate in that year’s edition of the annual Red Bull Music Academy. This prompted fellow RBMA alum Flying Lotus to look him up; the two actually met at the now-legendary Low End Theory party in Los Angeles, and within six months, Teebs was living in the same apartment complex as FlyLo and sharing a spot with fellow LA beatmaker Samiyam. Watching those two work fueled his own creative impulses, and he began assembling what would eventually become Ardour, his first full-length album.\n\nArdour may have properly put Teebs on the electronic music map, but the somber release – the LP was partially inspired by the death of his father, which took place in the middle of the record’s genesis – was just one of his many noteworthy efforts. He teamed up with fellow LA beatmakers Daedelus and Jeremiah Jae for split releases; he collaborated with UK producer Jackhigh (who now goes by BNJMN) on an intriguing EP called The Tropics and later joined forces with leftfield beat pioneer Prefuse 73 for the Sons of the Morning project and the Speak Soon, Volume One EP; Brainfeeder offered up the explorative and vaguely defined Collections mini-album; and the label arm of My Hollow Drum dropped limited runs of both Ardour B-Sides and the Cecilia Tapes Collection, the later of which collected music pieces that originally soundtracked one of Teebs’ art exhibitions. He’s also been busy on the road, frequently touring the globe, often in the company of his fellow Brainfeeder affiliates.\n\nDespite all of this activity, on a personal level, the last couple of years have been a time of relative calm for Teebs. It was during this time that he put together E s t a r a, his second proper full-length. As opposed to the turmoil that accompanied the creation of Ardour, his new album is an effort inspired by his life as it stands now, and represents a time when Teebs has finally been able to make music completely on his own terms. The record takes its name from the house where much of the music was created, and it finds Teebs filling his sonic canvasses with the same kind of lush, textured sounds he’s always used; the key difference is that he’s now operating with a renewed sense of purpose and a streamlined musical narrative. The techniques haven’t changed, but Teebs’ mastery of them certainly has. In short, he’s grown as an artist, and continues to confidently forge his own path forward.\n\nhttp://mtendereteebs.com/",

    "description": "~ Instill Creativity, Play, Laughter and Fun\n~ Introduce your Son to the Strength Found in a Circle of Men\n~ Show your Son that you are Aware and Awake to His Needs\n~ Give the Love, Approval & Blessing that a Boy Needs from His Father\n\nIn our work, men have shown us how deeply important their fathers are to them. Often, when a man explores his wounds and unfulfilled longings, his own father is at the base of them. Many times, a man’s limitations, his self-destructive patterns, his unrealized dreams, are rooted in his relationship with his father. Men frequently—often subconsciously—idolize their absent dads. They put their dreams on hold, decade after decade, waiting for the love and approval that only a father can give.\n\nBecause the father/son relationship is so important, we have organized a retreat specifically in support of men and their sons to help form strong bonds at an early age.\n\nFathers and their young sons will spend time having fun, learning about nature and sharing in playful, engaging activities. Boys will experience the power of simple rituals. They will witness mature men in a council circle, speaking truth, listening with heart, and providing support for each other.\n\nFathers will be encouraged to share stories of their own boyhoods, to express some of the joys and fears, and to help their sons to recognize the manhood that awaits them. Boys will be gently invited to talk about their lives, their hopes and dreams; the stories that draw them.\n\nThis gathering has become a tradition that gently and joyfully guides boys into their adolescence and manhood. We believe the passage into manhood to be one of the most important transitions a boy will make, and this retreat serves as a foundation for that transition.\n\nAlthough he may not recognize it, a boy approaching manhood benefits greatly from an aware father standing with him. We encourage and support the partnership.\n\nFathers and sons will have time away from each other, with the other fathers and sons, to do personal work. In some cases, the stories and processes need to be separate, with more orchestrated encounters when fathers and sons come back together.\n\nThere will be a spirit of celebration. Each man, and his sons, stepsons or nephews, will gain a new understanding of this most primary relationship; one that each father and son has struggled with, embraced at times and shunned at other times, but eventually come to honor. In the power of council, ritual, wild nature and soulful community, the beauty of fathers and sons will bless us all.\n\nDates: July 13-16, 2017\n\nLocation and Times: Private Wilderness, near Estes Park, Colorado. The gathering begins Thursday 3pm and ends Sunday by 2pm. Details and directions will be sent upon receipt of registration and payment.\n\nStaff: Led by James Churches and Staff. You can view biographies of our staff on the MLA website.\n\nCost $847 / per pair\n\nA minimum non-refundable deposit of $200 is required to hold your reservation and assure you of a spot in this gathering. Meals are included. Space is limited to 8 father/son pairs.\n\nIf you wish to set up a payment plan or inquire about a scholarship, please arrange with the MLA office prior to the event. Email Jason, jgeoffrion@mensleadershipalliance.org, for the MLA Scholarship Application Form.\n\nWhat To Bring – Upon receipt of your payment or deposit you’ll receive an email confirmation that will include a welcome packet with gear list, directions and other information.  \n\nFor more information or other inquiries please contact James Churches: 303-258-7475, jec@indra.com",

    "description": "NEW DATE\nKGNU Presents\nTHE ATLANTIC YEARS \nJean Luc Ponty Band  at Boulder Theater\n\nJune 13, 2017\nDoors:  7:00 pm | Show:  8:00 pm\n$30.00 BALC | $35.00 RES | $45.00 GOLD CIRCLE\nAll Ages\n \nDue to a scheduling conflict, the Jean-Luc Ponty Band performance at the Boulder Theater has been moved to one day prior on Tuesday, June 13, 2017. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. All tickets from the June 14th performance will be honored. \n\nAbout Jean-Luc Ponty: Legendary French violinist Jean Luc Ponty and his band will be bringing their “Atlantic Years” tour to the US beginning late May 2017! Jean Luc Ponty is a pioneer and undisputed master of the violin in the arena of jazz and rock. He is widely regarded as an innovator who has applied his unique visionary spin that has expanded the vocabulary of modern music.\nSays Jean Luc, “We're calling it 'The Atlantic Years' tour since I am touring with my band from the late 70's - 80's with whom I recorded several albums for Atlantic Records.”\nThe Jean Luc Ponty Band features:\nJean Luc Ponty – violin\nWally Minko – keyboards\nJamie Glaser – guitars\nRayford Griffin – drums\nBaron Browne – bass\n After studying classical violin at the Paris Conservatory, Jean Luc Ponty turned to jazz in the 60's. Thanks to his revolutionary style he collaborated with some of the best European and American musicians such as Eddy Louiss, Daniel Humair, Niels Henning-Ørsted Pedersen, John Lewis, Lalo Schifrin, and Quincy Jones. He became the first bebop violinist and US jazz magazine “Down Beat” created a violin category for him in its critics' poll, until then violin was in the 'miscellaneous instruments' category. His pioneering work on the electric violin in the 70's attracted the attention of pop and rock musicians, he recorded with Elton John and participated to several tours and legendary recordings with Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention and John McLaughlin's Mahavishnu Orchestra. In 1975 he founded his own band and became one of the most prominent figures of the jazz-fusion movement in the USA, selling millions of albums that all reached the top of the US charts. Ponty's most recent album “The Atacama Experience” is considered as one if his best and to this day Ponty keeps touring with his band around the world.\n \nPonty also collaborates on occasional projects such as “The Rite of Strings” with Stanley Clarke and Al Di Meola. In 2011 Ponty joined the mythical American group RETURN TO FOREVER IV with Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke, Lenny White and Frank Gambale for a world tour spanning on 5 continents.\nPonty received the 2007 Jazz Trophy in Germany, the medal of Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur in France in 2009, the 2011 Lifetime Achievement Awards in Ireland, and the Grand Prix of the Sochi Arts Festival in 2012 in Russia from the hands of world famous classical violist and orchestra conductor Yuri Bashmet. In 2012 Ponty performed his music with Orchestre Pasdeloup for his 50-year career celebration at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris, then again with symphony orchestras in Brazil, Russia and Hungary in 2012 and 2013.\nIn April 2013 Herbie Hancock invited him to perform in Istanbul at “International Jazz Day” for UNESCO. Ponty also founded a new quartet with his daughter, pianist-singer-composer Clara Ponty which performed in France and Germany in 2014. Ponty also performed with the 89 musicians of the Novosibirsk Philharmonic Orcherstra for the Siberian Christmas Festival.\nIn 2014 Ponty recorded an album as an acoustic trio with Stanley Clarke on double bass and Gypsy-French guitarist Bireli Lagrene, which was released on Impulse/Universal in the Fall 2015.\nJean Luc recently formed the Anderson Ponty Band with Jon Anderson, co-founder and lead singer of British progressive rock band YES, a CD and DVD was released in 2015 followed by a North American concert tour.\nThe Band:\nBaron Browne (bass) was born and raised in Georgia, USA, and gravitated to music at a very early age, learning to play his uncle's drumset at 7 years old. At age 18, Baron moved to Boston to study at Berklee College of Music. He began working full time with Berklee alum such as Kevin Eubanks, Tiger Okoshi, Mike Stern, Bill Frisell and Dean Brown. In 1983 Jean Luc Ponty called Baron to audition, and hired him immediately. Baron toured with Ponty for 3 years and collaborated to 3 albums. Since then Baron has toured worldwide and recorded with Billy Cobham, Steps Ahead, jazz vibraphonist Gary Burton, and recorded many albums with Walter Beasley. His versatility allowed him to also perform with R&B and Pop artists such as Brian McKnight, Tom Jones and Expose'. Baron also writes and performs regularly with Vital Information.\nJamie Glaser (guitar) is best known as the guitarist for grammy award winning musical acts, Jean Luc Ponty, Chick Corea, Bryan Adams, Gloria Trevi, Manhattan Transfer and more. His guitar can be heard on over 170 albums as well as on the biggest sitcoms of all time, Seinfeld and Married With Children. Jamie compositions can be heard weekly on CBS sports, ABC, Animal Planet, History channel, Discovery, and ESPN. His solo albums have been successful worldwide.\nRayford Griffin (drums) has been internationally respected as among the most inventive, volcanic and versatile drummers in music, having amassed stellar credits with virtuosos ranging from Jean Luc Ponty and The Stanley Clarke Band, George Duke, to Dave Koz, Anita Baker and Michael Jackson.\nWally Minko (keyboards) is a well respected and highly accomplished member of the LA music scene and has toured and recorded with some of the most well known and successful artists in the world! Some of the artists Wally has worked with include Toni Braxton, Pink, En Vogue, New Edition, Barry Manilow, Tom Jones, Arturo Sandoval, Gregg Rolie (Santana/Journey), Eddie Money and the Anderson Ponty Band, featuring legendary Yes vocalist, Jon Anderson and world renowned jazz violinist, Jean Luc Ponty.\nFor more information: www.ponty.com",

The group is comprised of some of the best talent to be heard, with varied backgrounds coming together from all over the country on bass, drums and keys.\n\nJaden Carlson, the front of JCB, with her oft face-melting prowess on the guitar as well as thought-provoking lyricism, has led many to tag her as an \"old soul\" and \"well beyond her years.\" Low in age but tour-mature, Jaden leads the music with the poise and character of a highly accomplished professional.\n\nChris Hunnicutt brings his low-end rhythm from years of gigging in the hotbed of Minneapolis gospel, funk, blues, jazz and hip-hop.\n\nEric Imbrosciano's depth of experience in blues, hip-hop, funk and jazz stems from his early years beating his drums around the New York scene before making his musical home in Colorado.\n\nAdam Revell's versatility from multi-genre influences and years of gigging with many different bands shines through in his playing the keys while providing soulful and melodic harmony on piano, organ and synthesizer.\n\nThe band has been appearing at some of the nation's most notable festivals: Summer Camp, The Friendly Gathering, The Vertex Festival,80/35, Bumbershoot, LEAF Festival, The Werkout Music and Art Festival, Jazz Aspen Snowmass, ARISE Festival, Bohemian Nights, and many others.\n\nThe Jaden Carlson Band has headlined major venues all over Colorado, as well as played direct support for national touring bands Twiddle, The Revivalists, The Werks, DeVotchKa, Robert Cray, Anders Osborne, and Marco Benevento just to name a few.\n\n\"Polychromatic\", an 11-song cd of all originals, is Jaden's fourth album and was released in October 2014, to both highly regarded journalistic and musician/peer reviews.\n\nJaden is the youngest musician to play legitimately on the the Red Rocks Stage at age 11 with Michael Franti and Spearhead, and again the next night with Blues Traveler; and has also played numerous sit-ins with Umphrey's McGee, The Revivalists, Lettuce, Dumpstaphunk, The Main Squeeze, The Nth Power, Twiddle, The Werks, TAUK, Zoogma, The Motet, Dopapod, members of Snarky Puppy, Vulfpeck, Big Gigantic, and many more.\n\nhttp://jadensound.com/\n\nSince forming in the Rustbelt of Cleveland, OH in 2010, BROCCOLI SAMURAI has been taking the club and festival scene by storm. The band's synth-laden, drum and bass influenced, progressive electronica has been thrilling audiences throughout the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast markets, winning them a massive and fiercely loyal fanbase. Eager fans pack dance floors and late-night festival sets with smiles across their faces, waiting to get lost in the band's ambient soundscapes, anticipating every bass drop that will force them to move with reckless abandon. Broccoli Samurai's line-up includes founding member Ryan \"Bruce\" Hodson on keys and synth, and Cameron Bickley on drums and percussion. Accomplished bassist Zach Wolfe anchors the rhythm section, while guitarist Michael Vincent weaves in and out, exploring new sonic territory.\n\nThe band has played countless festivals such as Peach Music Festival, Electric Forest, Catskill Chill Music Festival, Aura Music and Art Festival, The Werk Out, BIG What?!, Domefest, Paradise Music and Art Festival, Rootwire, The Mad Tea Party Jam, The Ville, SummerDance, Disc Jam, Night Lights Fall Music Festival, The Gathering At Chaffee's, Utica Music and Art Festival, and Hyperion Fest. Broccoli Samurai has directly supported and toured with many known bands including Dopapod, Papadosio, Lotus, Conspirator, The Werks, Ozric Tentacles, BoomBOX, Big Gigantic, Rusted Root, O.A.R., Pigeons Playing Ping Pong, Aqueous, and BIG Something. Broccoli Samurai's extensive tour schedule has them playing high profile venues and major cities regularly, and the band will be increasing the number of performances and expanding their reach into the West Coast and Southern markets in 2015. This band is making big moves and the time to take notice is now.\n\nhttp://www.brocsam.com/",

    "category": "OTHER",
    "description": "~ Step Into Manhood with Energy & Excitement\n~ Discover Pathways for Your Dreams & Passions\n~ Awaken to Your Empowered & Authentic Self\n~ Gain Acknowledgment From Your Family & Community\n\nThe Vision\nWe believe that healthy, empowered, and supported boys will grow into their mature masculine selves, and become balanced, whole, and just men in our communities, nation, and world.\n\nThe Passage\nAdolescence – making the transition from childhood to adulthood – is confusing and difficult, and keeping the adult heart and soul alive and well is a life-long practice. Our ancestors recognized it as one of the most critical times in a person’s life and as a crucial step for the entire community, and they marked the coming of age time with rites of passage. These experiences always used wild nature as the crucible and essential support for the transitions of adolescence. The wilderness affords an ideal opportunity for adolescent boys to learn, grow and take the first initiated steps into life as a young man.\n\nThe purpose of this trip is to support young men in the journey of adolescence, and to help them prepare for their passage into adulthood. This trip will help them take the first steps into manhood by awakening the innate framework – the archetypal imprint we each carry – for how to navigate life transitions.\n\nWe offer a five-day, four-night wilderness trip for boys ages 13-16, in a format we have used successfully with youth for over a decade, and in the fashion of a format that has been used across the world for thousands of years. After separating from their mothers, fathers and community we set up a camp together in the mountains outside Estes Park, teach basic wilderness camping and safety skills, practice respect for each other and the land, and hold council discussions around the many issues teens face, all in preparation for their threshold experience, which creates a sense of challenge marking the change to becoming a young man. We will also have fun, play games, learn tracking and other wilderness skills, eat well, and tell fantastic stories around the fire.\n\nFamily and Community Involvement\nEvery boy needs to be initiated, and it is the community’s job to do so. This is a time for the mothers and fathers to let go and step back. This is the time of the uncles and grandfathers to step in and initiate. Part of this ceremony is for the parents as well. There will be different rituals for both parents to cut the ties to their son as boy, and to welcome their son back as a young man. This step is vital for all the members of the family to move forward in strong ways.\n\nMothers will have time with their sons during the send-off ceremony at 12pm on Wednesday. The mothers will then gather again on Sunday at 12pm to meet with some of our women staff to discuss the challenges, joys and changing roles of being mother’s of their now young men.\n\nFathers will depart with their sons from the send-off and will ascend with their sons to the wilderness site of initiation. Wednesday evening they will have a ceremony with their sons and return home by 8pm. They then return to base camp on Saturday morning at 9am to have time together with our Elder staff to discuss the challenges, joys and changing roles as fathers or now initiated young men. They then will stay overnight Saturday night and come off the mountain with their sons on Sunday.\n\nCommunity Gathering\nThe passage ends with a full community gathering. The young men and their fathers, along with the men supporting the passage, will reunite with the mothers and siblings, along with other women, men, children, and elders from the community. Together we will feast and celebrate while we honor and bless the new young men by acknowledging and welcoming them and their gifts as vital and needed parts of the community.\n\n*We know in this modern age many boys do not have a mother or father active in their lives. We will have other men and women in the community to symbolically hold these roles for them during each stage of the weekend.\n\nLocation\nWe will drive and walk to a wilderness campsite on private land surrounded by national forest between Lyons and Estes Park, Colorado. It is beautiful and secluded land offering a profound sense of wildness and homecoming. Details and directions will be sent upon receipt of registration and payment.\n\nDates and Times\nJuly 26 – 30, 2017\n\nThe ceremony will begin at 12pm Wednesday at the turnoff to the land near Estes Park, and will culminate at 6pm on Sunday with a community welcoming and celebration. Parents, families and supporters of the boys will gather to send the boys off on this trip and to welcome back the young men on Sunday afternoon.\n\nFacilitators\nThe program is led by Jason Geoffrion and Gabriel Cannon, with Elders Tom Daly and Jeffrey Duvall, and other men and women staff. You can view biographies of our facilitators on our website: www.mensleadershipalliance.org\n\nCost – $947\n\nA minimum non-refundable deposit of $250 is required to hold your reservation and assure you of a spot in this gathering. Meals are included. Space is limited to 10 participants.\n\nScholarships are available. We believe it is the right of every boy to have their transition into manhood be marked, ritualized, and witnessed by the community. Please do not let financial constraints hinder you from marking this life-changing initiation.\n\nIf you wish to set up a payment plan or inquire about a scholarship, please arrange with Jason in MLA office prior to the event. And we welcome your donations if you have extra finances to help support boys who need financial aid.\n\n*A pre-trip letter and phone or in-person conversation between the boys and one of the guides is part of the preparation, getting to know each other ahead of time so we all can be safe on the land and fully enjoy this experience, and to make sure the boy and his family are ready for this passage.\n\nUpon receipt of your deposit or payment you’ll receive an email confirmation that will include a welcome packet with gear list, directions and other information.\n\nContact Jason Geoffrion with any questions: 303-444-9022, jgeoffrion@mensleadershipalliance.org",

And the show reflects that influence. Spaceface works to bring the concert grade experience to a club level employing a DIY light rig and other theatrical elements. They have two Ep's that were released in the past year, the first recorded at Pink Floor Studio in OKC and second at Ardent Studios in Memphis, TN. Spaceface is putting out a new LP called \"Sun Kids\" via Behind The Curtains Media on April 21st and will be touring in support of it nationally. The new album features artists Mikaela Davis, as well as our friend Julien Baker, and Engineered by Calvin Lauber from Pillowtalk and Daisyhead. The album is being mixed at Blatchwatch Studios in Norman, Oklahoma by Jake Ingalls and Jarod Evans, who most recently coproduced and mixed with Broncho, and worked on Sufjan Stevens' \"Carrie And Lowell\".\n\n\nFLAURAL\n\nhttps://flaural.co\n\nDenver-based quartet Flaural is a contemporary blend of new wave, shoegaze, and psych pop. The band consists of singer and bassist Collin Johnson, guitarist Noah Pfaff, drummer Nick Berlin, and multi-instrumentalist Connor Birch. Formed in early 2015, Flaural employs traditional rock instruments with a modern fare of abstract synth and guitar textures, driving 'kraut-y' drum grooves, and introspective lyrics and vocals.\n\nFLEECE\n\nhttps://www.fleecemusic.com\n\nFleece is a Montreal-based band that captures a unique take on the indie rock genre. Their music features psychedelic keys, wavy harmonies, groovy bass lines, slick guitar, and loads of delicious percussion.\n​\nFleece is perhaps most known for creating a viral video titled \"How To Make An Alt-J Song\" (May 2015).\n \nTheir comical take on Alt-J's songwriting structure was purposed as a silly video for their Montreal fans. The video currently has nearly 6 million views and has incidentally skyrocketed Fleece's fanbase throughout the world. Fleece now has two full LPs under their belt and are touring around the United States this Spring 2017.",

    "description": "~ Reflect On Your Current Challenges & Triumphs\n~ Release What Is No Longer Serving You\n~ Develop Trust In Your Gifts, Strengths & Internal Wisdom\n~ Gain Insight Into The Next Stage Of Your Life’s Purpose\n\nFor men seeking deeper insight into their life purpose and self identity, this program offers a potent rite of initiation in which a man’s old way of doing things and being in the world may die to that new way calling to be born into his life.  MLA offers a powerful ceremonial container in which a man can discover and define the gifts that he may offer to the world.\n\nCommunities around the earth continue to center their love, personal meaning, healing and spiritual existence with the experience of solitude, fasting, prayer, deep soul connection, mystery and vision in nature. \n\nThe way this ceremony is held is similar to the pan cultural experiences of life-long rites of passage and initiation traditions of all earths peoples who have gone before. It involves a preparation phase, a threshold phase, three or four days of solo time on the land, and an incorporation phase including a council of elders mirroring your connections and revelations while out on your solo. Together these stages aid in grounding in the body the truths found on the land.\n\nThis experience is possibly a once in a lifetime journey, or as our elders have shown the beginning of a profound practice stepped into often throughout one’s life. The experience brings to the awareness a story you return to time and time again as nourishment for one’s soul. It is a personal time that can bless many future ancestors. We end with a return to community and family paying witness to the unfolding wave of your experience for a full year after with periodic check-in and support calls.\n\nStaff: Jeffrey Duvall and staff. You can view biographies of our staff on our website - www.mensleadershipalliance.org\n\nCost: $1,197\nWe ask that you pay what you can afford and help with scholarships for other men if you can. Partial scholarships are available – we want to assure that everyone who is called to this journey is not held back due to financial considerations.\n\nIf you wish to set up a payment plan or inquire about a scholarship, please arrange with the MLA office prior to the event. Contact Jason Geoffrion to receive MLA’s scholarship form. \n\nA minimum non-refundable deposit of $250 is required to hold your reservation and assure you of a spot in this gathering. Space is limited to 8 participants by design.\n\nDates: June 10 – 18, 2017\n\nLocation: Private Wilderness Encampment, near Estes Park, Colorado\n\nWhat To Bring: Upon receipt of your payment or deposit you’ll receive an email confirmation that will include a welcome packet with geat list, directions and other information. Your meals before and after the fast will be your responsibility, however an outdoor encampment kitchen will be available for use.\n\nFor more information or other inquiries please contact Jason Geoffrion, MLA Director: 303-444-9022, jgeoffrion@mensleadershipalliance.org",

The week-long festival is part championship tournament, part poetry summer camp, and part traveling exhibition. \r\nAt the National Poetry Slam, 70-80 nationally ranked teams converge on a city bringing thousands of participants, fans and volunteers. Each team will compete at least twice, against 3 other teams. Scores are calculated across the tournament, and at the end of the third night we know who will move on to Semi-Finals and Group Piece Finals. After four Semi-Finals bouts, we take the winner of each to move on to Finals, from which the champions are chosen. The prize for winning is giant sword-through-a-stack-of-books trophy along with a cash award. And more importantly, bragging rights.\r\nFor the first time, the National Poetry Slam will come to Denver August 7 – 12, 2017. In its 28th year, the National Poetry Slam (NPS) is a Poetry Slam, Inc. event that brings together hundreds of poets from all over North America, and thousands of audience members. \r\nIn addition to the tournament, the event offers expert workshops and side events including the Haiku Slam, Nerd Slam, open mics that celebrate identity, and many other inclusive and welcoming performance spaces present opportunities for the local community of writers and audiences to participate. \r\nEvents will take place in downtown Denver and in Five Points, along the Welton Street Corridor. Our day events will include writing workshops led by experts from all over the United States, a haiku competition, and a series of themed open mics and poetry slams that will be open to the public.  The tournament kicks off on Tuesday, August 8 and six venues simultaneously, and will culminate in the final night of competition on Saturday, August 12, 2017 at the Paramount Theater.  \r\n\r\n \r\nFAQs\r\nAre there ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event?\r\nEach venue has its own age requirements.

Nominated for Grammy awards three times, the group scored hits with classic roots reggae tunes, War and Bredda Gravlicious, Firehouse Rock, and 1992 album and title track, All Over The World. Additionally, the group scored number one hits with Things and Time, Jah Jah, Old Broom, and Shark Attack. The Wailing Souls' recording career has been nothing short of historic. Vocally trained by Bob Marley and the Wailers' teacher, Joe Higgs, they worked with legendary reggae producers including Coxson Dodd of Studio One, Henry 'Junjo' Lawes, The Wailing Souls With Stevie Wonder In The Early DaysChannel One Studios, Delroy Wright, Lloyd 'King' Jammy’s, as well as recording several early tunes at Bob Marley's Tuff Gong Studio. The Wailing Souls attracted global attention when their music was featured in the 1993 Disney film, Cool Runnings. The soundtrack album was an international hit, selling nearly half a million copies worldwide. The Souls had three songs on this soundtrack including the hit, Picky Picky Head. Formed in Trench Town, Kingston, Jamaica, in the late-1960s, The Wailing Souls have experienced numerous transformations. Their discography (over 26 albums to date) includes singles recorded as The Renegades, Pipe & the Pipers, and Atarra. Sly & Robbie and the Roots Radics are only a few of the stellar musicians who have worked with The Wailing Souls. Still one of the most powerful forces in Reggae, The Wailing Souls continue to tour globally and record new songs with the vigor that they had singing in Kingston's Trench Town decades ago.\n\nhttp://www.thewailingsouls.net/",
